"The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K has completely transformed my home entertainment setup. The picture quality is stunning, thanks to the 4K Ultra HD streaming capability. Whether I'm binge-watching my favorite series or enjoying a movie night, the clarity and vibrant colors truly enhance the viewing experience.

Setting up the Fire TV Stick was a breeze – plug it in, connect to Wi-Fi, and start streaming. The user-friendly interface and voice-controlled remote make navigation effortless. The inclusion of Alexa is a game-changer; simply ask for your favorite show, and it's at your fingertips.

The vast selection of streaming apps ensures there's always something to watch, and the quick responsiveness of the device means no more frustrating lag times. The addition of Dolby Atmos audio takes the audio experience to a whole new level, providing immersive sound that complements the impressive visuals.

The Fire TV Stick 4K has become an essential part of my home entertainment setup, offering a seamless and enjoyable streaming experience. Its powerful and compact design is a game-changer for entertainment on the road. If you're looking to upgrade your home theater, I highly recommend this device – it's a compact powerhouse that delivers top-notch performance.",1
"I had not been familiar with the tv sticks until my cable provider is going to offer WiFi only. I was told about the these things and told how and what to stream. I googled what was the best out there and Amazon took the top honors on every site I read so I went to Amazon and they had the buy back or trade In your old device and I had a iPad mini that I traded in with a $5 dollar difference so I jumped on that plus my old device was only taking up space In my drawer. Make a long story short I hooked it up today and it’s amazing I can’t believe how much clearer my screen is the hearing what’s playing is %100 better there’s no skipping or trying to load it’s just awesome plus all the free content is the best part. So I’m going to be buying another one for my other smart tvs. You can’t lose with this tv firestick plus my friend went with the Roku And can’t get it working the setup is so easy if I can do it anyone can.",1

"The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K has completely transformed my dumb TV to SMART TV. Setting up the Fire TV Stick was so easy – plug it in, connect to Wi-Fi, and start streaming. Easy breezy! The picture quality is great.

The huge selection of streaming apps (free & paid), is impressive. The home screen and remote is very user friendly. I am very happy with my purchase. I will buy another one for my living room SMART TV.",1
"Really love this so far. I’ve had it for about a month and haven’t had any of the app issues others have talked about. All of mine populated with their graphics, etc within a few hours of being installed. That wasn’t as fast as usual, but I can’t use them all at once either so I wasn’t too worried about it.

I typically use this later at night in my bedroom on an LG TV that was my Mom’s. It’s a nice, larger TV that is not a smart TV and not connected to cable either so I really wasn’t sure how this would perform. It hasn’t let me down yet. And I’m very familiar with Amazon products. This is my 3rd Fire Stick and I also have a 42” Fire TV. It responds quickly, doesn’t lag during streaming (which is all I use it for) and I have only had to reboot it once.

My biggest complaint about this remote is that they didn’t add the light up in the dark option like they did when they upgraded the other stand alone version. What gives with that Amazon?? And I’m fairly certain this one costs more too (I think that remote is $39??). I understand this one is also a Fire Stick, but shouldn’t that mean is going to better?? More bang for your buck type thing. That’s my logic at least ;-)

Boo is all I can say to that. And double boo for removing Hulu off the bottom and adding Direct TV/Peacock. And there’s no extra button to add your own. Yes, I can ask Alexa to do it. I just don’t want to. I’d rather have my button back…but I’ll deal.

11/11/23 Updated: I’m adding this as it has begun to wear on my last nerve recently. I stream on my Fire TV ALL the time right now as I broke my ankle. A couple hours before I go to sleep I lay in bed continuing to watch whatever was on. Problem being is that when I go to launch the show from the “continue watching” it is NEVER in the right spot anymore! And I’m talking the completely wrong season even with plenty of time allowed for it to update itself once I’ve shut off my Fire TV. Paramount+ is the biggest culprit of this recently.
And then you may not even find it in the programs listed. I use my subscription via Prime because the PP app is wonky and I’m not paying Paramount for a sketchy app. Soooo I then have to go to the search feature and look the damn thing up…UGH!! Really?!? Please run an update and make my 11-12pm more pleasant…PLEASE!!! Yes, I know this sounds petty and maybe even stupid to some, but it’s inconvenient and not what I paid for. I’m also seriously impatient w/a squirrel brain. So there’s that…",1
"I already had a FireTV cube in one room and bought this to replace the Roku3 I had in my living room. Originally, I was going to put this in the bedroom and move the Cube to the living room, but this works so well that I didn't need to.

SPEED
Like my Cube, this is fast! My old Roku was constantly freezing, especially with YouTube. That's why I replaced it. Couldn't deal with it any more. This 4k Stick 2023 switches fast between apps and so far has not frozen. Plus, YouTube in this version has a speed setting so I can watch at 1.25 speed.

SOUND
A pleasant surprise I didn't expect is that the sound is so much better! I have this plugged into my plasma TV which uses Optical connection to my older Onkyo receiver. I used to turn the sound way up to hear the dialogue and then music, action scenes, and ads would be super loud and I would have to turn it down. I feel like I can hear the dialogue so much better now and don't need to constantly adjust the volume between scenes. My entire setup is the same so the only change was switching from the Roku to this.

SETUP
Easy setup since I already had it connected to my account. I didn't even need to enter my WiFi login. I still had to login to my Netflix and YouTube accounts but just used the QR codes to do that.

Honestly, I did not expect the quality of the 4k Stick to be so good. And for $30 on sale? This is an incredible deal!

It came with a USB cord and an AC plug for the wall in case your USB port doesn't have enough power or you just don't have one like me.

If you are on the fence and stream a lot because you cut the cord, you can't go wrong with this. Highly recommended!",1
"This replaced a WD TV Live Plus for me. It's much more responsive and significantly more/completely reliable at interacting with Windows network shares (samba). It's worked great with Amazon prime streaming, but I mostly use it with a sideloaded Kodi for playing content from my network. The 2 issues I've had with this device are the ads whenever you turn it on and Kodi losing audio connection and having to be restarted whenever the stick decides to put Kodi to sleep. The ads aren't that bad though; all you have to do is hit down a couple times and select the app/content you want to run/watch.

I didn't deduct any stars for the Kodi audio issue since the device isn't really supposed to be used that way anyway.",1
"I recently purchased the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K, and it has completely transformed my TV viewing experience. This streaming device is a must-have for anyone looking to upgrade their home entertainment system.

The setup process was a breeze. It was just a matter of plugging the stick into my TV’s HDMI port and following the simple on-screen instructions. I was up and running in just a few minutes.

The video quality is outstanding. The 4K resolution, along with support for HDR10+, brings a remarkable level of clarity and color depth to the content. Watching my favorite shows and movies has never been more immersive. Whether it’s fast-paced action scenes or beautifully shot landscapes, the detail is incredible.

The Fire TV Stick 4K also offers a vast selection of streaming services, including Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, and many more. The interface is user-friendly and makes it easy to find what I want to watch. I also love the integration with Alexa, which allows me to use voice commands to control the TV, search for shows, or even control smart home devices.

Another great feature is the remote control. It’s ergonomically designed and has dedicated buttons for power, volume, and mute, which means I don’t have to juggle multiple remotes. The added convenience of having a button for Alexa is fantastic.

In terms of performance, the Fire TV Stick 4K is incredibly responsive. Apps load quickly, and navigating through menus is smooth and lag-free. I’ve also noticed that the Wi-Fi connectivity is strong and stable, which is essential for streaming high-quality content.

Overall, the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K is an excellent streaming device that offers great value for money. Its ease of use, high-quality 4K streaming, vast content selection, and seamless Alexa integration make it a top choice for anyone looking to enhance their TV watching experience. Highly recommended!",1
"A lot of free apps, a lot of movies. Almost makes you feel like you're sinning if you're religious can't do this. Can't do that but there's so much to do on this and watch even games and also you can get a storage extension that think you just plug into the power stick. I mean I looked it up. They have it on Amazon which I might check it out because technically I tried playing a game. I think the max does better for games supposedly because it mentions it but I only had enough to get this one but I didn't realize I probably could have got the max and made payments on that. It's only $8 payments increments for this which I'll pay it off when I have the money. It's only 5 months six. Yeah five payments thought that was pretty cool. I think that's a prime benefit or something I don't know. Or it's to do with who your purchasing it through that accepts that and it's without application. It's just straight up. You make your five installments not too shabby now that I know that's on Amazon with the payments. Probably do that with a lot of purchases. If it's available, it's definitely convenient and it's low payments and increments five star worth it, especially for the price turns. Your smart TV into a another smart TV. I have mine hooked up to my smart TV because it don't have these apps 😂",1
"Streaming device from Amazon. It arrived and initially I thought I had a dud. I had it plugged into a HDMI switcher box and there wasn't any video or audio. Plugged it into a different non-smart TV and it fired right up, so I brought it back to my main TV (also a non-smart tv) which is easily over 12 years old now and still doing what TVs do best (I leave you to determine what that is... *chuckles*). After plugging it directly into one of the four HDMI ports on the back, it worked as intended. Eventually, I pulled it from the TV and plugged it into a roughly 8 year old audio/video receiver for surround sound and it works absolutely fine in it too. Recently, I pulled the plug from satellite TV which was charging too much for programming in terms of my budget and I used my ""cost savings"" to purchase one of these Firesticks for a more diversified and less costly entertainment solution.

I did learn this device has built-in Bluetooth support, which means you can sync it up with your smart phone or a gaming controller. I personally play quite a few retro games and was pleasantly surprised to discover it's possible to play them on this device by side-loading emulators on it, and that it can go up to roughly Sony PSP level gaming. NOT the heavier 3D games, mind you, but some of the lighter titles of the library work particularly well. Anything at Sony PlayStation 1 level and below that in generation will run flawlessly. Not a bad option to have sitting on the couch or in your favorite over-sized chair with nothing going on a desire to step away from the streaming stuff for a bit. *smiles happily*

Would I recommend it? If you don't have one of these or another device like it, then yes. If you already have something similar or a first generation Firestick, then I'd say no. Pretty straightforward. In my personal case, I didn't have anything like it and now I do. And it performs satisfactorily, I will say in conclusion.",1
"If you're expecting to view Prime TV content at 4K, this isn't the device you want. It generally displays Prime 4K content at 1080. It will claim that you don't have fast enough network speed regardless of your actual network speed. For example, mine is hardwired to the router, speed is always over 50MBPS. Yet the fire TV stick 4K, streaming 4K content from Prime video will only do 1080. Because my network speed isn't over 15MBPS. When it's actually over 50.

The first weird thing is that streaming services that are NOT Prime Video actually do stream reliably at 4K. The second weird thing is that with the same network connection, the Prime video app on my Tivo will reliably stream at 4K. It's only the Fire TV stick *4K* that won't stream at 4K.

Other than that it's a decent device. Video and sound quality is fine. The remote is fine. Selection of apps is fine, although of course the Prime Video app doesn't stream at 4K with this device.",2
"If you're debating between fire stick or Roku id go with roku. I got this to try bc I already have a Roku TV and there was a sale. There's several things I hate about this fire stick. When searching for options using Alexa it typically only shows me what's available on Amazon. Many times I've searched something using Google and found it streaming elsewhere for free. There's been at least 3 updates since I've owned this for about 3-4 months. The most annoying part is the update will continuously interrupt whatever youre watching even if you dismissed it earlier and haven't turned the TV off. I've also had several connectivity issues with apps. Anytime I want to watch Max I have to clear my cache otherwise everything freezes up and I have to shut it off and start over. A few hours into Pandora and the app stops playing music so I have to switch to something else. There's nothing positive about this device other than now my dumb TV can play apps for streaming. I would not recommend this to anybody.",2
"I use Fubo. I thought the Fubo app had issues, but it was the Fire Stick. Little by little, Fubo would slow, skip, freeze and kick me back to the home screen. Paramount +: I watched a series, season 4, with no issues. Got to season 5 and it would never connect. Error said check internet, but I could go to any other show on the app with no issues. Same on all TV's. Called my sister who lives elsewhere and shares Paramount + with me and asked her to access that 1st season 5 episode. She did with no issues. Switched all of my Fire Sticks out with Roku and haven't had an issue since. As for volume control, the Fire stick required one click at a time to raise/lower volume. Holding the volume button up or down did nothing different. Roku volume control allows me to hold the volume button down for a continuous change in volume until I reach the desired level. Voice control works much better in Roku and can be used in more places, like within apps, search boxes, etc. Fire Stick doesn't work within apps. Just go Roku and enjoy your streaming. I had just cut the cord and Fire Stick was my first experience and I was beginning to regret it. Roku has restored my confidence.",2
"It took six attempts over a full hour to complete TWO software updates before it was usable.
Finally able to turn it on, I found it out it didn't include Netflix or YouTubeTV among the choices of ""apps"" to view.

After much searching and being contacting by Amazon support over this review (that was initially a 1-star) I was able to get Netflix & YoutTubeTV installed. But you still can't just cast a Chrome tab from PC, or cast any video from an Android phone like you can with a Chrome-stick device. So it will have to be the second streaming stick on the TV I use it on.

Additional minuses:
- Extremely hard to get the case open on the remote to install the batteries.
- The menus on the screen guiding you through setup use a very small font - about .5 inches on a 39"" screen - that can't be read from a reasonable TV viewing distance. JUST BECAUSE THERE IS A ⏯ UNICODE CHARACTER, DOESN'T MEAN SOMEONE CAN READ IT FROM SIX FEET AWAY!
- Delivery took SIX DAYS using Amazon Prime on Cyber Monday.

One plus:
- comes with a dongle 4-inch long HDMI ""extender"" to attach to the TV in case your HDMI port is in inconvenient and/or your TV is wall-mounted.

[ edited and increased from 1 to 2 stars because I was able to add two critical ""apps"" ]",2
"I have to buy a new fire stick every year. The storage on them is Terrible. The new one I got Promised Extra Storage... Nope, same amount of storage space. I obviously like the fire stick, but as I said the Available storage is Not good.
(Yes, I clear my cache & data, it doesn't do much good.
*Edit... I received an email to contact someone who could help me... I have spoken to a robot and 3 Customer Service Reps and a Robot... Now you want me To Pay $5 to get question answered!?! Since I can't get Anywhere with CS, I'm leaving this on here because Amazon Quickly gets back to you if you leave a bad review. Also... I Requested a phone call and it said ""wait but your phone we will call in the next SIX hours!?! What!?! It is Saturday. I am Angry. I comply with Amazon Everytime they ask me to do something, now I feel I'm being Dismissed because I left a bad review... here's another one.
You know people Don't have to Leave reviews... but I do, a lot. I also answer questions for the Alexa game/thing... I have been using Amazon, like most people, for Years. I just feel disrespected.
**just so you know, it worked. After I left the 1st Edit, I was contacted Immediately.",2
"This thing is riddled with problems the worse being if you use a vpn you will not get speeds above 80mbps no matter how fast you internet is. I have a 600mbps connection and with a vpn cant get above 80 and usually wont go above 40. Changing settings or location makes no difference. The same vpn with exact settings and location on my laptop pulls over 300mbps. Stay far away from this one until they fix it. It also has issues with permissions. All of this should have been fixed before release but clearly they dont test their products before putting out upgrades. Amazon is dropping the ball heavily with these new devices and their locking them down is also a big issue. Ill also add that placing the usb input which has to be used for it to work on the side causes it to take up 2 hdmi spots because one cannot be placed where the cable plugs in. Why they would not put it on the back is beyond me and if you use the included extension cable it is not hdmi 2.1 and will cause constant audio drops if you use dolby atmos or any high def. Why they would pair a non hdmi2.1 extension with a device that needs hdmi2.1 to work properly again is ridiculous. If you have a first gen firestick 4k i would strongly recommend against this upgrade, you will regret it.",2
"This firestick has always been a little off. For example, if you select one profile it will kick back to the previous one. You have your home screen which looks like normal Prime. However, if you click on a show you may have been watching you can't view episodes or seasons, you can only pick up where it left off. To watch a different episode you have to then click on the Prime App, and select the show from that screen. Just really weird. And the final straw is as of yesterday I can't even watch a show. It will play the ads and then just kick right back out. I have a firestick from 2016 that works better than this new one.",2
"I bought this device to upgrade the Fire stick I have now because it was advertised as having 8GB of memory and my current device says it only has 5.28GB of available memory. When I installed this new device, the device's About page (in the Settings) shows that it also only has 5.28GB of available memory and that the few apps I installed (only 5 apps) ate up half of it. I called Customer Service and the Rep tried to convince me that software updating my device would increase the RAM of the device and that it would take several months (multiple updates). Tried to get me to believe that a software update would increase the available memory on my device when the device clearly said that there was only 5.28GB of memory available, in total. I am going to order the next tier device to see if it has what the advertised specifications claim. Very disappointed that the advertised specifications are not true. I like our Fire TV stick but need more RAM to load more apps. As it is, I have to load and unload apps to free up space on a regular basis.",2
"I have two sticks. One don't even comes up and the other one plays amazon movies but the sound and images don't match up. I read all over the internet that I should unplug it and turn it back on. That's takes about 10 minutes or more. That didn't fixed the problem. I do pay for Netflix and Peacock. Netflix never loads up. Peacock takes about 15 minutes to get a show or movie. Other movie streaming service do the same as Netflix. I know it is not my computer speed because I have 1000Mbps.",2
"The biggest con, is *partner apps may vary*. My old remote had all the 4 shortcut buttons i wanted, and this new one did not. Its odd how they conveniently hide the bottom 2 shortcut buttons, which for me were important. Old remote had Disney+, and Hulu shortcuts, new one had DirecTV and Peacock, which i do not use. Its odd how they hid the bottom 2 buttons on all the pictures. I should have read more into it, so its my fault, but they should have options for shortcuts, and make them plain and visible.",2

"I have not used a fire stick in quite a few years. It was in Grandma's room so she could watch her show Bones and others. She died this year and so the TV got turned back on. I had to order a new one because I wanted the live features for a BTS concert on the new Weverse's app. It worked perfectly and I was able to get JK's last concert live streamed. On the side notes there are more advertisements so I'm concerned about the younger generations watching the ads. But it does help you keep your mind busy and choosing what show you want to watch next. Also has a live option and I can watch shows live which are often seem to be just repeated. You can have leverage show or Bob Ross show or antique shopping show. A murder station etc I even have a new Asian with love station. Lots of different Asian shows are showing on that.,.......... If you do not have an updated or smart TV this is the way to go. All you need is an HDMI port. ( Do you need the original remote control or the ability to change the HDMI ports on the side of the TV........This is free service if you buy the fire stick. (Yes, there is Netflix and Hulu and others that you can pay for. They also have Vicki Asian channel. So you can buy things and rent things. Make sure you read it before you click the okay button. My mom paid for a bone show for $5 and she now owns that one show in that one season. She did not even get the whole season. Which you can do I'm sure you just have to read all the fine lines. So if you have children in the house you may have to set up the children's safety feature. They are quick to answer your phone calls if you have a problem. Highly recommend this for anyone with an older TV and who is not just sitting on their phone watching all the shows.",4
"It worked perfectly when I first got it. Made the mistake of allowing it to update and now every update there is another issue WITHOUT the prior issue being fixed. Now (after update 3) certain apps don't open unless I go through the ""Manage Apps"" section. The screen will sometimes shrink, so instead of it covering the whole TV screen, it will shrink to the top left corner taking up only a small fraction of the total area. The only way to fix it is to restart the Fire Stick...a bit aggravated, but it only happened after the updates. I put off updates for a while, but eventually decided to do it and then the problems started. I kept allowing updates because I was hoping the issues would be fixed, but no.",4
"I had the first edition of the Fire Stick for almost 3 years. Was working (well, sometimes I had to unplug and re-plug again) overall well, with no major issues. I recently purchased this latest 4K edition (not Max), and I encountered several problems: instead of upgrading, I had to install everything from scratch (why is that, makes no sense at all), install the apps again, and sign in with the credentials (please do not say for safety). Now, the home page is full of the movies on Prime (of course, it is an Amazon product) but the apps are scattered everywhere. And, as a dessert, once you're getting back the previous app you liked it, I got a message, ""No memory enough, uninstall some to have space"". Right Amazon, the previous 1st edition NEVEr gave me such a message. I did a lot of research before I purchased this edition, and I was expecting an easy installation and better work. I am not sure that I made the right selection/choice.. I can only imagine myself if I did purchase the International edition, and being in an EU country, I would experience the same or even worse frustration. It is just a comment...It will be your choice to ""be or not to be"". Good luck.",4
"This 4K version is noticeably faster and smoother than the old Fire Stick. And they're both thousands of times faster than the ""Smart"" circuitry in the Vizio TVs 🙄

I watch a lot of PlutoTV and Flex. Or is it Plex? Anyway, I am in a state of constant wonderment about the fledgeling Smart TV Advertising Industry, and whether my big TV can tolerate it if I throw my coffee cup at it. Mamasita, Oooooooo....

In summary, after a couple of years of watching commercials on a smart TV, I'm getting close to getting a paid service. Of course, you can subscribe to most any of them on the Fire Stick.

I think you can get them on a computer, too. Pluto, Hulu, etc... You can run HDMI from your computer to the TV, and then you don't need a Fire Stick, or Ruko, or anything. A real computer would provide fastest reaction times, and offer things like recording, time shifting, watching one program while recording another so there'd be no chance of ever turning off the TV... You plug a TV card into the computer, and they come with remote controls...

On another tangent (thanks for tolerating), the least compressed, highest quality video is on digital broadcast TV. I should go into the TV-antenna installation business, if I weren't afraid of heights. But you should start with a rabbit ears antenna duct-taped to your window, and see if you get plenty of free stations that way. Or any stations at all. Then, consider whether or not you'd be interested in improving your antenna system to get more, farther away stations. Make the F connector in the back of your TV work for a living.",4
"While this is probably a good device they recently made it unnecessarily difficult to access the Developers Menu Options and after I figured that out it did not help resolve the issue that I had purchased it to do. That is not the fault of the device, itself.
I did not try out any of the streaming apps so I have nothing to say about it. It is easy to connect to the TV and to setup the Wi-Fi in my opinion. Amazon allowed me to return it and refunded my money after they received it.
If I have need of a streaming device in the future I would probably buy a All-new Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device.",4
"original review was 1* and I tried to leave it at bottom of this update. Amazon responded to my review quickly first by phone and then email. At their suggestion I tried troubleshooting and restart. Not sure which action worked but it is more responsive and predictable than before. I have a couple of freezes, jumps to blank screen, and one really odd thing where I selected play for an item and it displayed the previous option screen rather than the one I selected. It did that repeatedly until returned to the home screen and then selected my choice. old review follows - this was a gift from someone the purchase was a hardship. sad because it is this “expletive deleted” device is infuriating. the menu is cluttered with apps and services amazon wants you to buy and the responsiveness to commands is glacial. every command is a prayer that most certainly will not be answered. the system goes wherever it wants whenever it wants and i'm not sure where i am when i get there. when i try to move from one selection to the next, more often than not it takes me back to the opening screen. if you are a gambler this is the device for you. if you have a low tolerance for frustration then avoid this purchase.",4
"Forget about it being registered to you when you receive it. You get to go to the magical process of doing it yourself, which I found to be a pain in the rear, since I had to relocate passwords. UPDATED: Tech Support contacted me regarding this item. One item was my misunderstanding: have to locate passwords for Netflix and Peacock. The second item was I had registered the device to myself however it connected my WiFi before registration. Customer service outstanding- the only item was registration was not the same as compared to the past.",4
"This is my first Fire Stick and my first Alexa device. I don't have a 4k TV but this was on sale and I thought it was a good deal. It lets my old Samsung TV get all the apps I couldn't get before. I only wish Alexa was voice activated. Instead, I have to hold down a button on the remote to use Alexa. I also couldn't get the remote to control my older DVD player.",4
"I didn't have any idea of the amount of content available until I received this product. There is always something I can at least give a try to see if I enjoy. There is a lot of content from other areas of the country and as long as you have a internet connection it's free. The only drawback seems to be when I Bluetooth it into my hearing aides sometimes the volume seems to vary and I may have to manually up or down the volume.",4

"I had not been familiar with the tv sticks until my cable provider is going to offer WiFi only. I was told about the these things and told how and what to stream. I googled what was the best out there and Amazon took the top honors on every site I read so I went to Amazon and they had the buy back or trade In your old device and I had a iPad mini that I traded in with a $5 dollar difference so I jumped on that plus my old device was only taking up space In my drawer. Make a long story short I hooked it up today and it’s amazing I can’t believe how much clearer my screen is the hearing what’s playing is %100 better there’s no skipping or trying to load it’s just awesome plus all the free content is the best part. So I’m going to be buying another one for my other smart tvs. You can’t lose with this tv firestick plus my friend went with the Roku And can’t get it working the setup is so easy if I can do it anyone can.",5

"The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K has completely transformed my dumb TV to SMART TV. Setting up the Fire TV Stick was so easy – plug it in, connect to Wi-Fi, and start streaming. Easy breezy! The picture quality is great.

The huge selection of streaming apps (free & paid), is impressive. The home screen and remote is very user friendly. I am very happy with my purchase. I will buy another one for my living room SMART TV.",5
"I already had a FireTV cube in one room and bought this to replace the Roku3 I had in my living room. Originally, I was going to put this in the bedroom and move the Cube to the living room, but this works so well that I didn't need to.

SPEED
Like my Cube, this is fast! My old Roku was constantly freezing, especially with YouTube. That's why I replaced it. Couldn't deal with it any more. This 4k Stick 2023 switches fast between apps and so far has not frozen. Plus, YouTube in this version has a speed setting so I can watch at 1.25 speed.

SOUND
A pleasant surprise I didn't expect is that the sound is so much better! I have this plugged into my plasma TV which uses Optical connection to my older Onkyo receiver. I used to turn the sound way up to hear the dialogue and then music, action scenes, and ads would be super loud and I would have to turn it down. I feel like I can hear the dialogue so much better now and don't need to constantly adjust the volume between scenes. My entire setup is the same so the only change was switching from the Roku to this.

SETUP
Easy setup since I already had it connected to my account. I didn't even need to enter my WiFi login. I still had to login to my Netflix and YouTube accounts but just used the QR codes to do that.

Honestly, I did not expect the quality of the 4k Stick to be so good. And for $30 on sale? This is an incredible deal!

It came with a USB cord and an AC plug for the wall in case your USB port doesn't have enough power or you just don't have one like me.

If you are on the fence and stream a lot because you cut the cord, you can't go wrong with this. Highly recommended!",5
"This replaced a WD TV Live Plus for me. It's much more responsive and significantly more/completely reliable at interacting with Windows network shares (samba). It's worked great with Amazon prime streaming, but I mostly use it with a sideloaded Kodi for playing content from my network. The 2 issues I've had with this device are the ads whenever you turn it on and Kodi losing audio connection and having to be restarted whenever the stick decides to put Kodi to sleep. The ads aren't that bad though; all you have to do is hit down a couple times and select the app/content you want to run/watch.

I didn't deduct any stars for the Kodi audio issue since the device isn't really supposed to be used that way anyway.",5
"I recently purchased the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K, and it has completely transformed my TV viewing experience. This streaming device is a must-have for anyone looking to upgrade their home entertainment system.

The setup process was a breeze. It was just a matter of plugging the stick into my TV’s HDMI port and following the simple on-screen instructions. I was up and running in just a few minutes.

The video quality is outstanding. The 4K resolution, along with support for HDR10+, brings a remarkable level of clarity and color depth to the content. Watching my favorite shows and movies has never been more immersive. Whether it’s fast-paced action scenes or beautifully shot landscapes, the detail is incredible.

The Fire TV Stick 4K also offers a vast selection of streaming services, including Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, and many more. The interface is user-friendly and makes it easy to find what I want to watch. I also love the integration with Alexa, which allows me to use voice commands to control the TV, search for shows, or even control smart home devices.

Another great feature is the remote control. It’s ergonomically designed and has dedicated buttons for power, volume, and mute, which means I don’t have to juggle multiple remotes. The added convenience of having a button for Alexa is fantastic.

In terms of performance, the Fire TV Stick 4K is incredibly responsive. Apps load quickly, and navigating through menus is smooth and lag-free. I’ve also noticed that the Wi-Fi connectivity is strong and stable, which is essential for streaming high-quality content.

Overall, the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K is an excellent streaming device that offers great value for money. Its ease of use, high-quality 4K streaming, vast content selection, and seamless Alexa integration make it a top choice for anyone looking to enhance their TV watching experience. Highly recommended!",5
"A lot of free apps, a lot of movies. Almost makes you feel like you're sinning if you're religious can't do this. Can't do that but there's so much to do on this and watch even games and also you can get a storage extension that think you just plug into the power stick. I mean I looked it up. They have it on Amazon which I might check it out because technically I tried playing a game. I think the max does better for games supposedly because it mentions it but I only had enough to get this one but I didn't realize I probably could have got the max and made payments on that. It's only $8 payments increments for this which I'll pay it off when I have the money. It's only 5 months six. Yeah five payments thought that was pretty cool. I think that's a prime benefit or something I don't know. Or it's to do with who your purchasing it through that accepts that and it's without application. It's just straight up. You make your five installments not too shabby now that I know that's on Amazon with the payments. Probably do that with a lot of purchases. If it's available, it's definitely convenient and it's low payments and increments five star worth it, especially for the price turns. Your smart TV into a another smart TV. I have mine hooked up to my smart TV because it don't have these apps 😂",5
"Streaming device from Amazon. It arrived and initially I thought I had a dud. I had it plugged into a HDMI switcher box and there wasn't any video or audio. Plugged it into a different non-smart TV and it fired right up, so I brought it back to my main TV (also a non-smart tv) which is easily over 12 years old now and still doing what TVs do best (I leave you to determine what that is... *chuckles*). After plugging it directly into one of the four HDMI ports on the back, it worked as intended. Eventually, I pulled it from the TV and plugged it into a roughly 8 year old audio/video receiver for surround sound and it works absolutely fine in it too. Recently, I pulled the plug from satellite TV which was charging too much for programming in terms of my budget and I used my ""cost savings"" to purchase one of these Firesticks for a more diversified and less costly entertainment solution.

I did learn this device has built-in Bluetooth support, which means you can sync it up with your smart phone or a gaming controller. I personally play quite a few retro games and was pleasantly surprised to discover it's possible to play them on this device by side-loading emulators on it, and that it can go up to roughly Sony PSP level gaming. NOT the heavier 3D games, mind you, but some of the lighter titles of the library work particularly well. Anything at Sony PlayStation 1 level and below that in generation will run flawlessly. Not a bad option to have sitting on the couch or in your favorite over-sized chair with nothing going on a desire to step away from the streaming stuff for a bit. *smiles happily*

Would I recommend it? If you don't have one of these or another device like it, then yes. If you already have something similar or a first generation Firestick, then I'd say no. Pretty straightforward. In my personal case, I didn't have anything like it and now I do. And it performs satisfactorily, I will say in conclusion.",5
"I recently upgraded my internet speed and can now stream video. My HDTV is 10, not smart, so I now have a 4K device for now and for when I upgrade to a newer 4K TV. Setuo was very easy and intuitive. Once the updates were loaded and I logged in I was off and running. So much to watch and Alexa helps me find what I want. This adds a new dimension to my antenna TV. I know I am going to enjoy this device for a long time while I discover more of it's powerful capabilities. It also offers a great picture, even on a HD 1089 set. Fire made sense to me as I have a Fire tablet and Echo. A friend much preferred this to a Roku, which he returned. It also allowed him to cut the cord and save quite a bit.",5
"This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.

This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!

So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.

Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.

If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).

So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.

The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.

Just be sure you have:

1. A TV with an HDMI port
2. Wifi at home
3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.",1

"I love the talk to the remote feature. Its fun. But i hate the fact that I cannot download any personal apps on it. Great product though.",1
"Received it fast. Connected to 1080p TV in my mancave. Easy setup. Updated automatically. Imported my FireTV setting seamlessly. Seems even faster than the older one. The volume buttons set up easily to operate the volume on the TV. Apps downloaded quickly. Works great!",1
"I bought this Fire Stick strictly for the Luna gaming app because I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a console. I bought it as a bundle with the Luna controller for $100. I have a 4K smart TV, so I really didn't care about anything but the Luna gaming app. Plus this is 1080p max, and as I said, I have a 4K smart TV. So I cleared every app that was deletable and hid the rest, as this comes with a lot of Amazon bloatware. The Luna gaming app works very well with the Fire Stick Ethernet Adapter, which I also bought. It also works without ethernet connected, but there is some lag. But like I said, I just bought it for Luna gaming and I'm satisfied with it.",1
"The Amazon Fire Stick is a game-changer for TV streaming. Easy setup, crisp 4K HDR visuals, and a voice remote make it a top choice.

"I have used various roku devices for the past 10+ yrs to meet all my streaming needs. However, I had run into a few issues w my roku device about a month ago bc quite a few apps(most notably Prime Video) had completely stopped working, and other than scouring their community forums to troubleshoot my roku device, customer support was nearly non-existent(my device was an older model and did not qualify for tech support). The absolute frustration i felt after purchasing a 4k roku stick and a Roku 4k Ultra and finding out that neither were compatible with my older smart tv, I decided to explore other options. I landed on the Amazon Firestick(their most current basic model) after reading lots of reviews on the device. It was also important that whatever device I chose had to have a robust customer support portal to quickly and easily handle any issues that may come up. The Firestick checked all the boxes! Now, compared to my roku express, the user interface is a bit less intuitive on the Firestick, but I had a good understanding of it after spending about a half hour exploring settings, etc. One HUGE benefit of the firestick is that you can open up a browser and sideload 3rd party apps that aren't available in app store. With the roku express that option wasn't available to me(though it may be different w newer roku models, it wasn't a feature mine had). So, maybe the firestick is a bit less user friendly than roku, but navigating through all my options, adjusting and personalizing my settings and app preferences took under an hour before I felt completely comfortable using and maximising all the benefits of my amazon firestick...oh! And I love love love that the remote is alexa enabled and will pair w my echo dot! I know newer roku models have voice activated remotes, but my cheapo and years old roku express did not! Even the most basic firestick has the voice activated remote control! Haven't really experienced any cons yet, but I'll update if I do!",1
"My 6 year old Firestick stopped working recently. I checked Amazon for a newer model. I noticed Amazon had a special where if you return your old Firestick they will give a $3.00 gift card and once they receive it they give you 20% off the cost of a new Firestick. That sealed the deal for me and I bought this updated Firestick (Not 4k). It booted up right away and it showed that all my previous apps were stored in the cloud so I was able to redownload all my settings and apps just by clicking OK. This saved a lot of time with setup as I thought I would have to reinstall all my apps again. The new version is noticeably faster than the old model. The new remote has special keys to jump right to Prime and Netflix. One new feature which i really like is having the TV volume control on the Firestick remote. Overall I’m very satisfied and by using the 20% discount and $3.00 gift card from turning in my old (non-working) model, it’s a bargain.",1
"I have a smart TV but turns out it was older than I thought and I was unable to download my new streaming service (You Tube TV). I ordered up an the Fire Stick and it arrived in one day. Easy to install I may have been a little naive when I ordered it as I assumed that the fire stick would get the power it need from the HDMI port that I plugged it into but that was not the case. The Firestick has a power supply that needs to be plugged into 110 outlet so be aware. Luckily, my outlet is behind the TV on the wall so it is not visible. Very easy to use. I was up and running in minutes. Highly recommend. The Amazon remote has essentially replaced my TV remote and it is small and simple and very user friendly",1
"I love the functionality of the Fire Stick. It is easy to use, intuitive, simple but easy remote. However, the reliability isn't very good . . . and Amazon obviously doesn't trust it to last very long either. It only has a 90-day warranty, which I believe is the worst warranty (for name-brand electronics) in the smart video-type business.

Mine very quickly just started to get painfully slow. Watching movies on it is great, but everything else is painful. Clicking on what you want can take over 5 seconds to respond. Of course you get to a point that you think that you didn't click and you click again, then it takes you into whatever the next click would have been. I takes several minutes to get back out of that and to what you originally wanted to click on. Moving just from icon to icon is painful, and the voice control is nearly useless. You have to hold down the button for a really long time, then speak, then wait a while to see if it actually caught it (if it didn't, it looks the same so it's tough to tell if it got it or not). This started to happen after about 4 months and has gotten worse since. Yes, I've applied the updates (which maybe *caused* the issue?), and I don't add other apps other than what it came with. I only use Amazon, Netflix, and Disney+ so I haven't exactly overloaded it with apps.

So to sum up, some work for a while and some don't. Amazon doesn't have enough trust in the product to even give it a 1-year warranty, and now I know why. With such a short warranty, the Mean Time To Failure must be pretty bad. If these tended to be robust, they could afford to put a normal warranty on them.",2
"Fire stick is slow/laggy there little space to store anything on it for apps. There no real apps from the about store. The main menu screen is a mess. I can not look at my blink system with this model with Alexa. I can see why it's 20.00 for this. I am use this for my kids room I never buy one for any other room in my house that what Google/android TV's for. If your looking for something cheap for your kids to watch there basic apps like netflixs,Hulu,YouTube, Disney,Tubi,peacock,sling tv,prime video then this will work. It does not have Vudu, and a lot of other apps because Amazon likes to act like there better and can not have a other app over junk Amazon prime video which has the worse picture quality then any app out there for the longest time and now they charge for ads so they are not even trying to compete with others anymore so try to remove them from there stores like they onces did with YouTube. The fire stick has not changed since there 2nd gen fire stick let's face it.This will just by me time until I get the kids a new smart TV.",2
"Lately it seems anything I buy from Amazon that is an Amazon product just sucks. You would think after all this time of doing this that Amazon could at least make a decent Firestick. Apparently not. I just received this yesterday and it doesn't work very well at all. Most of the time it just freezes up. It will say it is doing an update and then totally locks up. The first time it said it would take 1 to 2 minutes. Wrong after a mere 33 minutes it supposedly said still updating then when i tried to get out of it it just remained frozen. So I unplugged it and sort of rebooted worked for maybe 10 minutes then did it again. So the few minutes I have had it working it is far far worse than any Roku I have used. Sadly this a just a reflection of how badly Amazon is getting overall. I just found out few weeks ago that not only do we paying shipping to us, we now have to pay shipping back. I bought a small amplifier that after the 3rd time of switching it on the switch fell inside the housing. So i wanted to exchange it. So in trying to ship it back they wanted to charge me 7.99. I argued with them and they finally said okay we won't charge you. Then they lied to me and charged me anyway. So apparently the truth isn't important to them either. So since that little episode they have lost over a thousand dollars in sales from me. Just as all that was going on I had 2 chairs in my cart, a AC fan motor, another amplifier and a box of very expensive AC filters. Which totaled about $1076 bucks. I emptied my cart and bought from other sellers not on Amazon. Also I had close to 3,000 dollars in my save for later cart. I emptied everything out of it. I have been a member of Amazon since the beginning. I never returned anything that I ordered by mistake, I never returned anything because i did not like. I usually gave it to friends and family. The only things I returned were damaged or broken items or items sent to me from their error not mine. So I have now decided since I already renewed a few months back that I will not buy anything over $25 dollars if it is more than that I will buy elsewhere. I am finding already a lot of places are a lot cheaper than Amazon are these days. One little item i have bought from Amazon for years I found at my local supermarket for $2 dollars cheaper that Amazons. So because of their stupid new policy they have already lost a thousand bucks from me and that number will continue to grow. I hope whoever made that decision chokes on it.",2
"So, first off, I have using fire tv for years, it's my ""go to"". I'm all in when it comes to Amazon, I've just always liked the quality. So this is the first negative review of one of their products that I can remember doing but sadly I'm not a fan of this new fire stick. Since installing it, my internet usage massively increased. I didn't realize it until I got my bill this month, but had been given warnings by my internet provider that I was exceeding my monthly limit. I just blew it off thinking I was just getting close to it and really had no idea how much I used each month or what my limit was. This was the first time I saw the warning.
To add to this is the menu that is quite beautiful but slooooooooow. Netflix takes forever to load, hulu takes forever. The menu has recently started showing warnings that I'm close to being out of space. I look at the apps and I hardly have any. Yet, I'm still trying to delete apps and its still slow. I simply do not understand. It tells me that the capacity is gigabytes, yet all the apps I have barely add up to one gigabyte.
So I use Eero for my home wifi mesh and thankfully it has a great dashboard to help track down the bandwidth usage of every connected device. Yesterday we were gone most of the day and all evening and came home and went to bed, yet Eero shows that the fire tv used nearly a gigabyte of data! How is that possible for a tv that is off?

One interesting thing that I noticed the other day was that I switched on the tv and it went right to showing some movie on Showtime, it didn't go to the main menu. It was interesting but I thought nothing about it. Now I wonder if while my tv is off, content is still streaming to the fire stick? Is that possible? It would explain the rapid increase of internet data usage.

I do not recommend this version of the Fire TV Stick. I give it a few stars because I liked the new remote with individual buttons for the main content providers (netlix, hulu, etc)

Edit: Last night I tried to do an update and it kept erroring out. I believe because it was out of space. I hardly have any apps on it, so it has to be something else that has gobbled up all my space. So, I decided to start over and so I ""reset to defaults"". The first thing I did when it was rebooted clean was make sure I had every update available. Amazon had the option to grab my profile so I didn't have to add any apps, the ones I normally use were added (netflix, hulu, and plex). Looking at my space now, I actually had a 1.5 to spare now and the menu was snappy and quick. Also, my technical opinion on my massive uptick in internet usage is that when I turn off my tv, the fire tv keeps my connection to hulu or showtime alive and I'm still using bandwidth. This is evidenced by occasionally when I switch on my tv, the first thing I see is a moving or show playing via one of my streaming accounts and not the main menu which is what I would expect.",2
"I purchased the newest version of the Fire TV Stick (Nov. 2023) because I wanted a more standard remote; previously, I streamed everything via my Playstation. Unfortunately, whenever I use the Fire TV Stick, there are constant ads on YouTube Premium and Prime Video that I do NOT see when accessing these services through my Playstation or laptop. The whole point of paying extra for no ads is...no ads. It completely defeats the purpose to have constant ads breaking up my viewing experience when I use the Fire TV Stick (it's especially bad when I want to stream relaxing/anti-anxiety music for my dogs because out of nowhere THERE IS A SUPER LOUD OBNOXIOUS AD PLAYING every few minutes). I've also noticed that when I watch NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube TV via my Playstation's YTTV app, I get some ""moments of zen"" (nice nature sounds/animal photos) instead of commercials but that doesn't happen when I watch YTTV via the Fire TV Stick.

Also absurd...I can access more shows and more episodes of shows available on Amazon Prime Video when I'm using my Playstation than I can when using the Amazon Fire TV Stick. Unfortunately I recycled the box in which my Fire TV Stick came, so I can't return it. I don't even want to donate it to someone because I'd essentially be giving them something that interrupts paid content every few minutes to show ads. This Fire TV Stick is essentially garbage and I'm incredibly disappointed in Amazon.",2
"I like the layout of the Amazon Fire Stick remote but in my experience their life span is abysmal. In the last 9 months, I have needed to purchase a total of 6 of these to use with two TVs (one in the den that gets used mostly just on weekends and one in the bedroom that gets used daily, almost entirely in the evening only). Doing the math, these remotes have lasted me approximately 3 months each before each has malfunctioned in some way, requiring me to have to buy a new one (I’ve googled every method I could find to reset one of these in an effort not to have to purchase a new one, with mixed results but still, most haven’t survived past 3-4 months). After the first couple died I decided I would only re-purchase when on sale. At this point I’ve come to the conclusion that the short life span doesn’t even justify buying at a sale price. Most recently, my Hulu interface wasn’t working right (it would literally kick me out of Hulu every 5-10 minutes while I was trying to watch a program; whether the program was live TV or a recording didn’t matter) and at first I thought the problem was Hulu but after seeing that Hulu didn’t have this problem on the other TV at that time or on either of our tablets I came to realize that the problem was caused by yet another malfunction of the Amazon Fire Stick. So I decided to stop throwing my money in the toilet at that point and switched to a Roku remote (I have since purchased a second Roku remote for the other TV as well as that Fire Sick began to malfunction not too long afterward on the other TV, as well). So fat the Roku remotes are working flawlessly and the Hulu interface is working correctly again (confirming the Amazon Fire Stick was the problem and not Hulu). The only thing less than perfect (for me) is that the Roku remote doesn’t have a built-in “Hulu” button on the remote like the Fire Stick does (I mostly watch Hulu) but it’s literally only one extra click to open Hulu from the Roku’s Home Screen (instead of pushing a dedicated button right on the remote) and while I haven’t been using the Roku remote long enough to compare its longevity to the Fire Stick, it’d be hard not to top the average of 3 months I’ve gotten out of multiple Fire Sticks so I’m giving Roku my business now and we’ll see how this goes. It’s 100% worth making one extra click to open Hulu if Roku has a better life span than the Fire Stick (again, I think it’d be hard not to considering how short lived most of my Fire Sticks have been). I am a fan of Amazon branded products in most cases, but not this particular product as no one enjoys wasting hard-earned money on having to replace the same thing you just bought a few months ago over and over again, right.",2
"Used to love my firestick and have 4 in my house. After updates to the ui last year I hate these things and am probably switching to roku next. They changed the interface so it takes 8 button presses to get to the episode select screen for a show where it previously only took one button press. My younger kids that can't read yet can't pick episodes anymore and I constantly have to help them with the TV now. Apps are more unstable now taking very long to load and crashing back to home screen frequently. Remote is frequently non-responsive. Having these problems on my 2 fire tvs and 2 fire sticks and it all started with an update last year and amazons customer service is useless. I don't know why Amazon is ruining this product, it used to work great.",2
"I thought this would be a great solution for using streaming apps and downloading a few games to play casually, but the firestick simply hasn't lived up to my expectations.

First of all, there are ads playing the moment I turn the thing on, which is mildly infuriating, and there are also a dozen bloatware apps preloaded that I will never use, yet they can't be uninstalled. I purchased and downloaded 3 games, which turned out to be a mistake because I was constantly getting low storage notifications prompting me to free up space.

This lead me to buying a 128gb usb stick to expand the capacity so I could download and store the apps that I actually want. The problem is that there are some apps that can't be moved to the usb. There were games I purchased that I simply had to uninstall, and guess what? I can't re-download them to my usb stick without repurchasing them. What a shady business practice and a waste of money! I was totally deceived and will be finding a streaming / casual gaming solution elsewhere.",2
"I bought this because I loved the first version and I wanted to upgrade. While this newer version is faster, I don't really see any other benefit. Additionally the remote is always not working. Consequently, I have had to reset, re pair, and troubleshoot this remote sooo many times and after a while it just stopped working completely. So now I have to use my phone which was extremely difficult to set up because the remote was not working. It is also very inconvenient because if anyone else in the house wants to use it they cannot unless they have my phone. So now I have to purchase a new remote. Meanwhile, back at the ranch my original Gen 1 Firestick and its remote is still working.",2
"I have had this for almost a year now. I got it to replace my fire tv that broke after falling off the stand. It started out fine, but at this point I wish I could still return it. Each day I try to play something the remote will not even move over to the app. Once the button finally moves over to the app you want, and opens it, it inevitably crashes. Yesterday I tried to use three different apps and they all crashed. I finally got one to work after restarting the tv, but it ended up crashing after ten minutes of the show. But don’t worry, it can still play all the ads on the Home Screen just fine. Save your sanity and go with something else.",2
"This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.

This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!

So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.

Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.

If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).

So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.

The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.

Just be sure you have:

1. A TV with an HDMI port
2. Wifi at home
3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.",5

"BACKGROUND:
First off, I bought the Amazon Firestick 4k MAX to replace the Firestick 4k that I have had for just over a year. The reason being: Amazon was constantly off-loading my apps (that I use regularly) non-stop. This is even after turning this feature off in the settings. This was due to the firestick being low on space (5.34 Gigs I believe). Keep in mind I only use like 6 apps (YouTube, Spotify, and streaming apps) and would frequently clear the cache and data for all of the apps due to the lack of available space. I was also having more and more frequent app issues like sluggishness, freezing, apps not opening, and apps crashing.

I eventually found a way to get more space by purchasing an OTB cable and flash drive. This basically keeps the same cable connections but provides a split line for a USB port where you can connect a flash drive for additional space. When the Firestick (4K not 4K MAX) recognizes the external storage device it will prompt you to reformat the flash drive file system to FAT32 so that it is compatible with the Firestick. I did this and after a couple of minutes it said it was complete yet there was no additional storage shown in the settings anywhere (should have been in Settings > My Fire TV > About > Storage). I tried troubleshooting this with customer service and after an hour determined it was a firestick issue. So I bought the newest version with the most space available on it...

The Firestick 4K MAX:

-- The Positives:

1) The setup was quick and simple. I was able to easily keep my previous settings and most of my apps.
2) The flash drive / OTB cable for additional space worked right off the bat without any issue.
3)Having to log back into my applications, I noticed a nice new feature that allows you to scan a QR code to use your phone as the keyboard which I thought was awesome (AT FIRST... see Negatives below).

-- The Negatives:

1) WHAT I HATE THE MOST = You cannot disable the screensaver, they completely removed screensaver settings. You can modify the duration but some apps will trigger it early. For example, HBO Max, after like 5 minutes of a paused movie or show it will kick you out of the player screen and back to the info page where you have to hit a button to resume it. So this will trigger the screensaver now. The real frustration is that when it goes to the screensaver now, the only way to get off the screensaver is to hit the Back button on the remote BUT THIS WILL NOT TAKE YOU BACK TO WHERE YOU WERE, IT WILL KICK YOU ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE HOME SCREEN OF THE FIRESTICK! I've had this thing set up for a couple of hours and spent most of my time searching the internet to find ways around this... to which there are currently none.

2) They hide the Developer Options (you now have to click on it 7 times to enable it but they don't tell you that)

3) They now run ads on Amazon Prime ---> *shoot me in the head* How annoying... Is nothing sacred??

4) When you pause a show or application Amazon now runs ads --- *shoot me again* -- AND when you back out of the screensaver ads, guess where you go? Back to your app or show??? NOPE... back to the Amazon homescreen.

5) Since this was the first time setting up, I had to log back into the accounts for my application, which is kind of a pain, especially if you use passwords with security in mind. I was pleased to see there is a new feature where they provide a QR code at the login screen that you can scan with your phone and then use your phone's keyboard. Great! Except none of the logins were successful on any of the apps I tried. However the same credentials worked fine when I put them in using the remote (maybe it is adding a space at the end that I didn't notice but odd and ultimately nonfunctional).

6) They added more ways to track your usage, I had everything disabled on my previous device and those did carry over to this new model but there were other things that were new. If you value your privacy, I would take the time to go through all of the settings, particularly the Preferences.

7) More storage (16 GB) yay! But why in the world did they move away from having a SD card slot (got rid of this after the Fire TV and changed to Firesticks)??? This was such a simple solution to storage capacity issues, which are now almost inevitable for most users.

8) Is the Alexa feature getting worse?? I have been getting some very off-beat results for my searches, especially for applications, or when asking to search/open a show on a specific app I have installed.

OVERALL: They added some features that I'm sure some people will find value in, like the new screensaver widgets, theme options, and an AI image generator (beta). But if you are like me and value functionality, settings customization / choices, and performance, then this will probably be a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT to you as well. So much of a disappointment that when you keep getting kicked out of your apps, movies, and shows to the home screen you may soon find yourself in front of your computer writing a pissed-off review. Keep in mind this is my first-hand experience with the 4K MAX (software and remote fully updated - 02/29/24) within the first few hours. I have also owned a Fire TV (a box-shaped option they once had) and several previous Firestick models (I've been a consistent user of Amazon devices since 2016).",1
"Edit # 4.

I have both the old 4K max, and the new version 4K Max, connected to my LR TV. One weird problem is that on the new 4K Max, playing NFL games on Thursday night prime video, the video looks horrible, blurry, and buffers a lot. I put up with it through 1.5 games, and then I decided to play it on the older version, and the older 4K max was problem free playing the Thursday night Prime football game. Kind of strange because the new max is Fire OS 8, while the old Max is Fire OS 7. I will still keep it, hoping for updates to fix the various problems. So, the list of the problems with the new 4K Max keeps growing the longer I use it.

Edit # 3. 10-10-23

The greyed out third-party icon problem has been resolved with an update. The ambient mode has no stay on timer or no way to adjust how long it stays on the screen, after 15 minutes it goes to a black screen. What good is an ambient mode that only lasts for 15 minutes? While watching the NFL on Prime video, it produced very blurry video especially during fast motion scenes. I initially blamed it on the Prime video feed, but I have seen other complaints about the same thing from other reviewers. The audio settings problem that I mention down below has not been resolved up to this point. So, one problem has been fixed through an update, but there are many more than need to be addressed.

Edit # 2. 10-3 2023

The audio settings is a problem on the Fire TV Gen 2 4K max. The sound problem on the second Gen 4K Max is that of the 4 available audio settings: (Best Available, Dolby digital Plus, Dolby Digital, PCM), setting it to Best Available does not give you the best available audio. Setting it to Dolby Digital Plus on the Gen 2 4K Max gives more options and much better sound than setting it to Best Available. That is not how it worked on the Gen 1 4K Max. Best available was THE Best Available and gave better sound. This is an audio bug on the Gen 2 4K max. Between that problem and the greyed-out apps, and other software bugs that I have experienced, I am dropping the rating back to 1 star. If these issues are not resolved with updates from Amazon by 10 30-2023, which is the end of my return window, I will be sending it back for a refund.

Edit # 1:
Initially I rated the Fire TV 4K Max as a 1-star product because of sound problems and the greyed-out 3rd party icons. I do not know if there was an update, or if it took some time for it to mesh with my Denon AVR, but instead of mostly PCM audio sound codec usage, currently it has given me better Codec options like Dolby Digital, Dolby ATMOS, and multi-channel in, for sound from my Denon AVR. I will say that I made 1 major change to my home entertainment setup. I turned off all HDMI CEC control options on all of my system components. CEC is and has been problematic for me, and others. The thing is, the HDMI CEC worked with the 1st Gen 4K Max, with some of HDMI CEC options turned on. The HDMI CEC was also causing me other problems not related to the 2nd Gen Max.
IMHO, HDMI CEC is problematic and really not ready for prime time. So, if you are having home entertainment problems, 1 option would be to disable HDMI CEC on all your devices.
The greyed-out 3rd party icons are still a problem though. So, at this point it is a 4-star product until they fix that. It is a little faster than the Gen 1 Max, double the storage, and the picture quality is just as good, if not, a little better, than Max 1. I was going to return it before the sound came alive. Now, with the much better sound quality, and sound options, I can say that I would recommend this product as a major upgrade to any older fire sticks. Also, it is an incremental upgrade to the 1st Gen 4K Max. I believe it is a very good upgrade for the price.

Initial review:
The audio codec utilization is not as good as it is on the previous Gen1, 4K Max. Instead of Dolby Digital, it uses PCM for a lot of the video content. I have an expensive surround sound setup and the 2nd Gen 4K MAX produces much worse sound quality, using lower quality codecs, at a lower volume, and with less surround sound detail. My second complaint is the dreaded grayed out 3rd party app icons. That also was a problem on fire OS 7 until it was fixed with an update. I will give Amazon 2 weeks to fix both of these problems. After that I will just return it, because the 1st Gen, that I already own, has neither of the problems that I have mentioned in this review. If they get it right on the next iteration, I will purchase that one. Not happy with this product at all.",1
"Yes, it is definitely faster. The 16 gigs let's that happen. Install was quick since I left the old Stick plugged into another Hdmi port. The extra channel and options buttons are a nice plus. BUT !!! Having Peacocktv and DirecTV as the bottom two presets is the first MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT.

Then January 17,2024 Firetv lost the ability to show closed caption on Over The Air television with my FireTvRecast. Five weeks later the software was updated and it was working again. So, I then decided to purchase the new 4k max. Unfortunately, the closed caption issue was inherited on Amazon's latest Firestick, MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT number two.

I know Amazon is going to stop supporting the Recast in a few years, but if the doesn't support Closed Caption for live TV then I have to recommend dumping Amazon as a supplier for all TV viewing at some point.
It's a shame that Amazon makes me feel like they don't seem to care about its hearing impaired customers. Along with this issue the play, fast forward, rewind and pause functions are slow and have many glitches with OTA TV.

There are none of these glitches on my older firesticks. I only updated to get a better remote control and more memory.

To top it all off Amazon sent me a Promo code that would have saved me an extra 10 dollars
five minutes after shipping my FireStick and charging my card.

So while the product is good enough.

If you or anyone you live with needs to watch OTA TV with the volume off, or have hearing issues, buy something from someone other than Amazon or find an older version of the Firestick that my suit your needs if you don't mind the slower response of the units with less memory.",1
"The inbuilt Amazon streaming app in my TV sometimes has 'issues' so I bought this to bypass it. (and its problems) Little did I know this device has its own 'issues'.

First off, it was quick and easy to setup. Sadly it requires more power than what is natively supplied by the HDMI connector so it needs to be fed external power.

The first problem/issue is the layout of its menu system. Unpaid for paid content ALWAYS comes up 1st at the top of the list along with add's pushing Amazon content & events. There is no way a user can change this, your stuck scrolling over whatever Amazon is pushing you to purchase or consume.

The device does a fairly LOUSY job of keeping track of what your watching and waiting to watch (on watch list). If you make the mistake of subscribing to partner 'channels' it gets even worse with each individual 'channel' having its own media priorities that they are pushing rather than the content you were recently watching.

A major problem with the device is its inbuilt 'timers' and the user has no way of changing them. Pause a stream to answer the door/phone/hit the restroom and come back to find your 'FireTV stick' nowhere near where you hit the 'pause' button on your remote! Instead of allowing your TV to invoke its own screen saver the FireTV Stick kicks you out of the content you paused to its own 'screen saver' which then require many 'clicks' or navigation to get back to where you were when you paused it.

During the time using the device it has only had to 'buffer' while watching content ONCE and the audio does not cut in/out like the Amazon streaming app on my LG Smart TV.

While I have a 4K TV I have not tried the 4K functionality of the device. I generally like binge streaming & viewing old TV shows commercial free. (which I'll have to pay EXTRA for soon as Amazon is adding commercials)

Conclusion: it is a mixed bag - in some ways it works better and others worse than my smart TV for streaming content.",1
"and more work when using the remote, from a device that should be making it easier on the user.

The new “Autoplay” feature is simply awful, but thankfully that can be manually disabled… sadly, that isn't the big problem. The problem is that when you press the ""home"" button, you used to get the home screen. Now when you press the ""home"" button, you get ad that you have to hit the down button to clear so that you can actually get to a usable home screen.

The home screen has always been slightly obnoxious in that half of the screen is devoted to banner ads, but now the Fire devices are running a full-screen version of the banner ad that you must click through to get to the home screen's actual usable content.

I think that Amazon is likely A/B testing this feature since there seems to be some confusion from users who might not be experiencing this escalation of companies making their products progressively worse.

The previous escalation prior to the new full-screen home ad was injecting ads to the Amazon Photos screen saver. That was already intrusive, but didn't slow down the general use/navigation of the device. But now that there is a forced new step which requires positive action from the user to dismiss, the experience is degraded.

I suspect that this ad space is quite valuable since there is a high probably that actual human eyes are viewing the ad. Unlike ad buys on social media platforms where those ad views are mostly bots (shhh, don't tell the ad buyers they're getting ripped off!), Amazon's Fire TV home screen is valuable ad real estate. Thus, Amazon is going to milk it for all it is worth.

Alternative options are few. Most (all?) Smart TVs, Roku, and Nvidia Shield include crass/obtrusive ad content in their home pages. Apple TV seems to be one of the few platforms where the home page experience is relatively ad-free.

One can only hope Amazon will backtrack on the huge miss-steps in this initial launch software wise.",1
"Purchased this newest fire stick and have had nothing but freezing up problems every time it automatically goes to the ambient mode. I can't resume anything at all except for main menu and then re going to the original program and or app after hitting the main menu button. No other functions will work on the remote when it does the constant freeze up when trying to get out of ambient screen saver. Attempting to connect with anyone from AMAZON IS A FRICKIN JOKE. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO ANY OTHER PERSON NOR WOULD I EVER RECOMMEND AMAZON TO ANYONE AS WELL. THE ROBOT CHAT CHARACTER IS SO STUPID WHEN TRYING TO ASK A BASIC SIMPLE QUESTION CONCERNING MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS NEEDED TO BE ASKED.
Amazon Prime benefits now completely are worthless, and can't ever depend on receiving a purchase. AND 2 DAY DELIVERY ONLY OCCURS ABOUT HALF OF PURCHASES.
Amazon will immediately take your payment but if you need a refund they then tie up your money for up to a week WETHER IT'S THERE MISTAKE OR A CANCELLATION. THEY SAY THEY TAKE YOUR MONEY WHEN THE ITEM ACTUALLY SHIPS OUT, BUT I HAVE PROOF THAT I'VE HAD PAYMENTS TAKEN OUT WITHIN MINUTES AND BEFORE I EVEN COULD TRY TO IMMEDIATELY CANCEL AN ACCIDENTAL ORDER. AND EVERY TIME THAT OCCURS THEN IT TAKE A MINIMUM OF 3 DAYS BEFORE I GET TO EVEN TOUCH MY REFUND. Amazon was wonderful but like most good companies, THEY HAVE SWELLED HEAD SYNDROME AND DON'T CARE A BIT ABOUT CUSTOMERS.
AMAZON NEEDS MORE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, AS OF NOW THEY HAVE NON. Amazon Corporation is all about receiving and doesn't care about anything once they have payment. BRING BACK THE MALLS SHOPPING AND WALKING EXPERIENCE. IT WAS SO BETTER, NICER AND JUST PLAIN OUT FUN TO JUST WALK THRU MALLS AND MEET ALL WALKS OF LIFE. TO BAD N SAD.",1
"Pros: CPU is 2% faster than the last stick! (The stick is still laggy though)
50% more storage!

Cons: Side loaded app icons not loading up!
Ambient mode is a glorified screensaver!
After 25000 years you still can't turn off the sleep mode!
Bluetooth cuts in and out!
Buggy operating system!
2GB of ram in 2023!
16GB of in 2023!
4 core CPU in 2023 (LOL!)

I am a owner of a first gen fire stick max and I have to say it's way better than this stick in the software department than the 2nd Gen max! The Ambient mode description claims that the sleep timer is disabled when its activated but it is not it turns on in about 20 mins. So this defeats the whole purpose of having a screensaver mode (oh I'm sorry Ambient mode.) Also for some ingenious reason Amazon still does not have a off button for the sleep timer to stop the fire stick from going black every 20 mins! For the life of god Amazon add a off button for the sleep timer! Ever since I got the 2nd gen max the Bluetooth cuts out off and on all day even though the 1st gen didn’t. I use the Bluetooth for my wireless sound bar because amazon is compatible with every other sound bar on earth but the one I have. For some reason amazon can't find the IR code to use it with So I have to use Bluetooth to control the sounds on the bar or use 2 remotes. And for the specs of the 2nd fire stick max its not all that much better then the last stick. And furthermore having 2GB of ram, 16GB of storage and a 4 core CPU is a sin. Its 2023 most cellphones has better specs than that, hell my cellphone was 100 bucks new and it has 128GB of storage, 4GB of ram and a 8 core CPU. It does everything this thing can do and I can make calls on it too. And finally don't be dumb like me and buy something new on day one. Wait about 5 months till they fix all the bugs that wasn’t a problem in the last stick. They rushed this buggy mess out to make money and they're going to fix the bugs later. It should be a law against companies doing this!",1
"I ordered the Firestick because I have an LG tv which is lacking a lot of streaming apps I enjoy. Our upstairs TV has a roku which has everything, but I figured I’d try out the popular firestick to see how it went.

The firestick’s app library isnt as inclusive as rokus but it did have just about everything. Unfortunately its incredibly slow. At one point I waited 5 minutes from when I hit “play” on the Max app, to when the video actually started. Before you point fingers at my internet, I dont have this issue with any of my apps on the TV itself (the Max app is on both my tv & the firestick). I did look into it to make sure I was doing everything right on my end, and after multiple checklists, nothing worked. Eventually the firestick I ordered (less than a month ago), had issues updating. I went through another checklist to try and figure out why it wasnt updating. The final stop on the checklist was to completely reboot the whole thing. Well, in order to set up the firestick initially, it needs to update, which the firestick wouldnt do. I call customer service, and they send me a new one.

I got the new one today, and its just as slow, if not slower than when I initially set up the first app. As pictured, the icons aren't even loading in. This isn’t a few seconds of waiting - but literal minutes until I simply gave up and tried a different menu - of necessary icons needed to operate & navigate the primary menu. I’ve done all the recommended steps (restart, unplug it, change the hdmi, etc)…

Im just going to return it and get a roku. I recommend yall save yourself the hassle and do the same.",1
"I never wrote any reviews about an Amazon product before. But, after buying this Fire TV 4k Max and the struggles I have been going through with it, I am finally writing a review about it and rating the second generation Fire TV 4K Max as a 1 star product because of its audio and video problems. The sound problem on the second generation Fire TV 4K Max is that of the 4 available audio settings: (Best Available, Dolby digital Plus, Dolby Digital, PCM), setting it to best available does not give you the best available audio. Setting it to PCM, Dolby Digital or Dolby Digital Plus on the Gen 2 4K Max makes no difference either. That is not how it worked on my old Fire TV 4k stick. Best available was giving me the best sound. I believe this is an audio bug on the Gen 2 Fire TV 4K Max. Also, on my old Fire TV 4k stick, as soon as I select the HDMI option on my TV where the Fire TV 4k stick is connected, I could see the HDR video option shows up on top of my TV Screen and the video quality improves drastically. But now after switching to the second generation Fire TV 4k Max I don't see any difference between normal video and HDR video. I spent hours looking at multiple troubleshooting videos posted in YouTube and made lot of changes with hope to see that the Fire TV 4k Max will magically give me a good video and audio but no use at all. I don't remember giving a 1 star rating for a product recently. But for sure this Fire TV 4 Max second generation is a 1 star rating product. Not at all worth the money.",1
"My Roku broke and I got a Fire stick to replace it. I chose this option because it was cheaper for the larger storage capacity. Big mistake. I should have listened to the reviews and gotten another Roku.
Parental Controls: The parental controls are a nightmare. They are difficult to use, input, and change. Amazon staff suggestions to fix play and access issues don't work. You can't enter the pin verbally. If you try you get some function that they gave that number.
Menu: The menu isn't user friendly, contains nothing but Amazon ads, and adding and accessing non Amazon apps is a pain. The Amazon ads are even worse on the Fire Stick then on the Echo Show.
Settings: Prime Video settings didn't transfer to the new device and had to be reset, including accessibility settings. This makes no sense since the settings are connected to the Prime account and not the device.
Like: The things I like better about the Fire stick are the price and ease of connection to my TV. However, be aware that you will still need to use your TV remote for some functions as stated in the device description.
I thought choosing the most current model would address some review issues. I was wrong. Do not go for this cheaper option. Stay with or get a Roku if you are looking for a streaming option to add to your TV.",1
"I've used chromecast devices and other casting sticks in the past, and this one is certainly among the best. It has good loading times, and installing apps is a generally smooth experience. For most people, this stick is going to do everything they'd want it to.

Most of the issues I've faced are things that can be fixed via software. Using a few Echo speakers, I was able to set the FireTV stick to set up a home theater. There was a point where it stopped working, and I had to reset the device group multiple times to get them working again, and even more hassle to get ARC working, but when it does work, it's great.

One of the biggest complaints my family and I have comes to the device's insistence on going to sleep mode while a video or a movie is paused. With Ambient Experience enabled, leaving the device idle paused will kick you out of whatever you're watching, and in most instances, the app you used won't remember where you left off, and you have to fast forward to the point you were at. There is also no way to disable sleep mode entirely - and the options you're given to enable sleep mode are all too small in their length of time. A mode that allows you to put the device to sleep after, say, two hours of idle would be great, but the option is not there.",4

"UPDATE 6 WEEKS LATER:
Amazon has made some noteworthy improvements with subsequent software updates.

Ambient Experience: It's still a bit laggy - Amazon has more optimizing work to be done here. But it's not nearly as bad. Also, originally the Ambient Experience always shut off after only 14 minutes and there was no option to change that; but Amazon has added options to set a longer timeout, including up to several hours or ""never."" The AE isn't perfect, but it's much better now.

Permissions: Amazon added in the Manage All Files permission with the 8.1.0.1 firmware update, and it works correctly. They could do a better job at documenting this - you have to know to go into settings and manually grant the permission, you can't do this in a pop-up permission request - but it does work, so that's an important fix. The other permission differences (like Nearby Devices) are, in fairness, only really for use with sideloaded apps for power users, so it's no surprise that Amazon hasn't added those into the interface.

Some users had experienced that problem that sideloaded apps showed blank icons, but Amazon fixed that very quickly.

There are still other minor glitches with Fire OS 8, but it's much more stable already, and working well for its primary purpose - streaming. I think the Max is shaping up to be a reasonable and much cheaper alternative to the Fire TV Cube now for those who don't need the hands-free voice and HDMI input. The Max is also much faster and with double the storage compared to the sluggish Chromecast with Google TV.

A note on the remote control: unfortunately, after a few days the solid-feeling remote control loosened up. The upside is that the battery cover comes off more easily now. But the bad part is that the remote is now *very* creaky and feels so loose it's almost like it could come apart in your hand with ordinary usage. It doesn't, but it sure feels cheap.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
For context, I've been using the Fire TV Cube 3rd Gen as my primary streaming device for several months, after trying a number of Android TV devices and having problems with all of them. I got the new Fire Stick Max 2nd Gen to try out Fire OS 8 and the Ambient Experience.

It turns out that Fire OS 8 and the Ambient Experience are the problem here.

The hardware is the best I've used in a streaming stick or dongle. Snappy and responsive overall, great wifi, plenty of storage. In fact, in browsing the UI and launching apps, the Max is not far behind the Cube, and wifi is every bit as good.

But the Ambient Experience is a problem. It's a good idea, it looks nice, and it has lots of options. But those options are rather confusing. More importantly, the AE is disastrously laggy. When customizing, it'll lag long enough you'd think it didn't register a button press at all. When launching the AE, the screen goes completely blank for several seconds as if the TV was shut off, before very slowly loading the image and widgets. It needs a ton of optimizing before it's any good.

And Fire OS 8 based on Android 11 is a problem here too. What's the same from Fire TV 7/Android 9 still works just fine, but some of what's changed is broken.
Most notably, Android 10 and 11 introduced lots of permissions changes that required apps to be modified and users to adjust their settings. And Amazon seems to have totally missed out on that for Fire OS 8. The most obvious is storage permissions: in Fire OS 8, file managers and other apps that access storage like VLC - apps that are in the Amazon Appstore - are just completely broken, because there's no way in the UI to grant the new storage permissions. (Storage permission is listed in settings, but it doesn't work.) These changes were announced more than 4 years ago and were very widely discussed and reported on throughout the Android world, so there's no excuse for Amazon not to have addressed that in preparing Fire OS 8. (The permission can be granted at the command line using adb, but that is cumbersome and should not be needed just to let a file manager manage files.) There are other permissions issues, too, but storage is the glaring serious problem.

Quick note on the remote: although it's the same buttons, size, and shape as the remote with the Cube, the build quality is quite different. The Cube remote feels really cheaply built and is creaky and slippery; the Max remote feels like good quality and doesn't creak. On the other hand, it's really difficult to open the battery cover on the Max remote.

Amazon has done a good job with the hardware on the Max 2nd Gen. But they have a lot of work to do to optimize and fix bugs in Fire OS 8 and the Ambient Experience.",5
"Addendum: I have to reconnect my LG remotes to work with the Fire Stick every two days resetting the exact same features.

1. Using the Fire Stick remote, you click on the sun at the middle bottom, click on Settings - Display and Sounds - HDMI CEC Device Control - turn it on. If it's already on, turn it off and back on. Exit to main screen

2. On the LG remote click on the cog in the bottom right (long press generating 4 menu options) - General - Devices - HDMI Settings - Simplink. Even if it is turned on, turn it off and back on.

3. My TV always turns on to the Fire TV home page and I still have to use the Fire TV remote to connect to the page with all the TV options. Then I can use the LG remote. Older Fire TV sticks did not work this way.

Original review compared Firestick to Apple: Firestick: I'm a long time Amazon Fire Stick user (upgrade each time a new stick comes out). I just got this latest Fire stick and it's harder than ever to navigate. I had to watch videos to try to get this new one to work like the last one and I still haven't gotten the screensaver to work right nor have I gotten control of the interface to work as well with my LG remote. Sometimes when I first turn on the LG TV, it goes to the Firestick screen saver and I have to punch up to three buttons (random if it works at all) to get to my menu screen. Other times, the LG remote won't work at all and I can only use the Firestick remote. The quality of the image is spectacular, better than that with the LG app.

Apple: Works as advertised. Easy to setup. I laid my iPhone next to it and it got what it needed in less than a minute. It worked out of the box with my LG control but doesn't work with the generic control the spouse uses. The quality of the image and sound (on a new high end LG TV) is the same on Firestick and Apple. More predictable and easier to navigate than the Firestick.

Probably because I'm familiar with Fire's busy screen and have it organized to suit me, it's my first choice. I find the Apple screen too simplistic. If I was choosing one to buy for someone less tech savvy, I'd get the Apple. If I have guests, I'll set the Apple up on their TV.",5
"Amazon customer service is the worst. Our new fire stick, less than 1 month old, totally died on us Monday night. We couldn't get it to work, and our internet was working fine, our Roku was working, and our old stick was working. This new stick was obviously defective. I called customer service, and they told me to go through the return process. I told them that we do want a stick, just not this one, that is clearly dead. They said, ok, we will send you a new one. I though great, problem solved. But no..... when I didn't receive the new stick in a couple of days I check ""my orders"" online and it says that I requested a ""repair"" - what?? I did not. It wants me to send it back and then wait for them to repair it and send it to me. So now all this time is wasted, and amazon has an unhappy customer.

Edit added: I called back customer service and got a very nice agent who was able to straighten everything out so now I am happy again. :-)",5
"We had a Fire Stick 4K that was working well, but after adding just a few apps, it quickly filled the available 8Gb of memory. This resulted in frustrating delays when using the remote as well as apps frequently freezing/exiting during use. For months, I tried dealing with the issues by resetting the stick, clearing the memory, deleting apps and cache. It would work for a few days and then despite not loading additional apps, we'd be back to memory issues. I bought this 4K max replacement with double the memory in the hopes that it would help. It currently works as well as the one it replaced, prior to the memory issues. The remote is slightly larger, has additional buttons for changing channels and doesn't come with batteries. The additional memory literally costs less than $1 more, but like every other electronics company out there, Amazon uses that to charge $10 more. However, with FIre Stick, the 8Gb version is VERY limiting and should be discontinued.",5
"What i dont like is having to purchase new fire sticks on a regular basis. I have a drawer full of older ones that just couldnt keep up with memory. Just bought the 4k non max not to long ago but the memory on the devices does not keep up with the app requirements and they are loaded with bloat ware. 16G on the new max is really only about 12G of available data space and that amount of data is super cheap so why do you keep limiting it. These do work much better but when i received the first one our of two i purchased the background experience did not work but finally after putting info on the boards and a push update overnight it finally worked. I even tried in the past the adapter to have external storage but many of the apps wont allow you to move to external so that purchase was a failure.",5
"I upgraded my internet to fiber and the new wi-fi router is able to speak wi-fi 6 and I was given a teaser about this unit in which they mentioned that it was wi-fi 6 capable. The install went great and it is responsive, but there are some glitches. If you leave your show paused until the pretty pictures come on, hitting the play/pause button will not bring you back to your show like it did on the old one. You need to hit the return (U-turn) button to get back and in most cases, that takes you all the way back to the streaming services logo page and you have to navigate back to your show. On another note, the old remote had no issues controlling my TV and sound bar, but this one can't seem to be able to power off the sound bar. I have to find the other remote for that. The other thing that made me cranky was in the original email announcement, they mentioned a substantial discount, but when I got around to placing my order, the discount code no longer worked. I didn't see that the code had an expiration date, but it must have. Grrr.",5
"I am upgrading my review. I am not sure if it was the upgrade that got pushed, Changing around my HDMI connections, or just rebooting everything for the umpteenth time, but I now have the preview window back on my recorded shows. And this was the only reason for the original low review score.

there are some nice features on this new stick and if i had a ring doorbell, i might give that would be a nice feature.

However, i no longer have the preview window when i fast-forward on show i DVR'd with my Fire TV Recast. It is very frustrating and cancels out any new features that i don't use. And i have reached out about how to fix this (as have many others) but we have all gotten the same useless instructions with no follow to the comment that they didn't work.

"I had a firestick and remote that had become outdated and did not operate as it was meant to. So, I read the reviews and decided to order this new one. It was an easy set up and I was relieved to find that it was an upgrade to the one I had been using. My only gripe is that I used an extender to plug the stick into the HDMI slot in the back of my tv and that caused some issues. The stick would go to the home screen and despite what app I selected or show I selected, it would return back to the home screen again within minutes. Once I had the brilliant idea to unplug the extender and plug the firestick directly into the HDMI plug, the issues were resolved. So, don't use the extender.",5
"The Stick itself I have few complaints about. It did lock up a couple of times, but hasn't lately. It does not know how to switch to the ""Media Box"" input on my Sony receiver (?!?). Fully understanding all its settings will give your brain a workout. It comes with a little HDMI pigtail that helps ease installation. You can plug it directly into your home theater and bypass the ARC nonsense

The remote falls short in three places IMHO. First, it needs to be backlit. One typically watches TV in a darkened room and backlighting would be a major improvement. Second, put something on the bottom to keep the remote from slipping out of your hands. Some little ridges or bumps. Third - increase the size of the MUTE button. In this new FAST (Foisted Ad Saturated Television) world, you will find it is the most used button by far.

EDIT: The FireStick has disappointed me. It cannot run Spectrum TV app, and it cannot run Kodi. D minus.",5
"First, let me say, I loved the flavor of these and they did the job of giving me a little pick-me-up....

BUT! Please be aware of the possible side effects because I wasn't. I was drinking one or two of these about every day or every other day (the recommended limit is two cans a day) depending on my single-mom sleep deprivation. After about a week of doing so, my stomach was DESTROYED. I had no idea what was going on as I was unaware of the issues sucralose can cause until a friend happened to mention that it was worse than sugar for you. So I looked into it.....On top of the usual risks of cancer and other diseases, it can ruin blood sugar regulation, trash your gut health and healthy bacteria, and promote a pro-inflammatory response in your intestines. Which is exactly what happened to me.

Y'all....I thought I was dying. Bloat, constipation, diarrhea, dehydration, fatigue, lack of appetite. This went on for about 2-3 weeks after that week of on/off consumption. I ended up tossing the rest of them and detoxing it out. I was a mess. Haven't touched one since and never before has anything destroyed my stomach as much and I pride myself on having an iron stomach haha. I can eat pretty much anything and not get sick. But not these....

"I wish I would have known before I bought this that the ingredients contain cyanide. One sip equals 4 times the amount of cyanide that is acceptable in daily human consumption.

They scrape it off the top. They dry it, turn it into a powder, ship it to a facility, synthesize it with a metal, and put it in your vitamins. They take metal, hydrogen cyanide, and put it in our supplements.

"I drank this flavor for a long time and had it on Subscribe & Save so multiple family members could enjoy it. It was consistently delicious for more than one year. I received some cases that tasted very bad, all were manufactured on the same date with “Exp 08/24.” Amazon nicely credited some recently received cases. The reordered cases say “Exp 11/24.” The first ones were great but the last two taste solely like Green Tea which unfortunately I do not like. I don’t know what is going on here. Has the “Formula” changed? Are there storage issues with temperatures changing tastes? I can’t drink a can without a two hour window to gag it down. The Fuji Apple Pear got to where I couldn’t drink it either so it may just be my taste buds. Although you can tell I don’t believe that.

I couldn’t find the correct Redbull flavor I enjoy so I thought I’d try something new. This is the true meaning of regret. I’m not sure who was drunk that day or if they decided to find someone who had no sense of flavor or smell but they found them and put them in charge of choosing their entire drink selection. I’m sure the first tester tried it and was immediately rushed to the nearest hospital but they decided not to allow this to affect their decision process at all. Next they went to a swamp somewhere awaiting federal EPA cleanup. Using this water from somewhere in Canker Shores Florida they tapped deep into this water source. Since advertising wasn’t concept familiar to anyone, they decided putting a tiny fruity picture on each can. This definitely would draw in the customers even though there’s no reasonable link from the fruit to the flavor only to indicate what flavor is definitely not in each can. Well enjoy each sip of irony and press 9 and 1 before drinking the remainder.",1
"Oh boy, where do I even start with Celsius? It’s like they decided to bottle the essence of disappointment and call it a “healthy energy drink.” I’ve tasted better things in my life, like accidentally licking a battery or chugging cold medicine for fun.

From the very first sip, it’s like my taste buds went into full panic mode, desperately searching for anything remotely pleasant. But alas, they were met with a flavor that can only be described as a failed science experiment mixed with a dash of betrayal. I mean, who thought combining medicinal bitterness with artificial sweetness was a good idea?

The aftertaste lingers longer than that one awkward moment from five years ago that still haunts you at night. You know, the kind of aftertaste that makes you question your life choices and wonder if you accidentally licked a laboratory floor instead of drinking a beverage.

But hey, it’s not all bad news! If you’re looking to acquire a new superpower, drinking Celsius might just be the way to go. Forget about invisibility or mind reading; this stuff gives you the power to contort your face into the most impressive grimace known to mankind. It’s like your facial muscles are having a wild dance party while your brain screams, “Abort mission! Abort mission!”

On the bright side, I’m pretty sure Celsius has successfully made me appreciate every other drink I’ve ever had. I mean, I now genuinely enjoy the taste of tap water, and that’s saying something.

So, if you’re in the mood for a drink that will make your taste buds cringe, your facial expressions resemble a Picasso painting, and your regrets come rushing back with every gulp, then congratulations, my friend! Celsius is here to make your wildest nightmares come true. Drink at your own risk, and may the tastebuds be ever in your favor!",1

I don't know if it's legal or not or but it's certainly not ethical.",1
"In the beginning, loved all the flavors, so subscribed for 2 12 packs every month, occasionally I would get one that had a metal taste and no tasted of the flavor it was labeled to have. I received my current order and the first 2 cans of orange, both had that metal taste in them. I did notice when I opened both cans that they over flowed like soda cans do when shaken, which never has happen before. Anyway contacted Amazon for a refund and stopped my subscription for them. I am not planning to drink any of the remaining 22 cans, just going to dump in sink. Order the Ice caffeinated drinks instead.",1

I decide to buy it online because it’s the only place I could find 12 pack of this flavor only. I tried several and they all have an off putting taste. They taste like dirt! It’s not just me. I’ve had other people try it and they say the same thing. They are not expired or anything. I thought maybe it was my taste buds until I got one from a retailer yesterday and it tastes just fine. I will not be buying again online",1
"I buy Grape Celsius on a recurring order. Most of the time I love it. Occasionally I'll get 3 or 4 cases that taste like kerosene and look like it too. Its a pale orange color. Not sure if its sat in a warehouse or something wrong with the blend. If someone knows why this happens I'd love to know. I end up throwing out 3 or 4 cases because if one is bad they all are bad.",1
"It does provide me energy without the burnout afterwards compared to other energy drinks. I do not like the flavor however which is objectionable. The mango isn’t too sweet of a flavor and taste artificial. It is not carbonated and taste like a weak warm juice even when cold if that makes sense. Will not order this flavor again.",2
"Received order yesterday. 4 cans were damaged, dented, tops crushed in. UPS delivered. This does not happen when USPS delivers. Matter of fact, USPS deliver one pack of this and UPS the other two. Should not happen for the price. This was the first time it has been damaged like this.",2
"I first tried this flavor at a gas station and it was so good, tasted just like Coke. I was excited when I found a case on Amazon as the grocery stores didn't carry this flavor. However, the case I got tasted kind of flat, had 0 fizz. I would not buy it again.",2
"Seems like this is a bunch of cans that fell on the ground and didn’t break, so they assembled a custom 12 pack mix and decided to sell it. All are flat tasting, and there is no rhyme or reason to the mix quantities. Cheep but flat tasting. Way to go Amazon.",2
"I really enjoy these drinks and bought the variety pack to try out new flavors. However, I was very disappointed when the drinks that came were not the ones pictured/listed that I hoped to try but ones I had many times before.",2
"These erupt when opened like they were shaken up. They've been sitting on the counter and have been sitting there for weeks. Whenever you get one and open it, they explode. Don't know how this happened, just a heads up.",2
"I had two can out of the case that was flat and looked like they was going to explode. Ordered before I needed it. Noticed it today when I opened the case. But, since it's past the return policy I can't doing anything about it. Not very happy. Order came in on the 17th of this month. Open it today the 24th.",2
"I bought this thinking I was getting what was in the picture but there was 6 flavors with 2 of each flavor not 12 in a variety, im upset because I wanted to try the mango and the cold and the grape but instead am stuck with double of flavors I don’t even like. I wouldn’t have bought if I knew that.",2
"I bought the peach raspberry fizz and was so excited but received blue razz no fizz… I love Celsius but I’m kind of upset",2
"Should be called the flavors we cant sell pack🤮,99% of the flavors i got ive never seen in store cuz nobody wants them",2
"I wanted to try this brand but my stomach doesn't do well with fizzy drinks and was pleased they have the peach tea. It's tasty but has a bit of a chemical taste. I am glad I tried it but won't be keeping it in my rotation of beverages. Got it for a better price here then in the grocery store too.",4
"This CELSIUS Sparkling Lemon Lime is definitely a different breed of fizzy drink. Compared to classic Sprite, it's like a pumped-up, fitness-focused cousin. Taste-wise, it leans more tart than sugary sweet, with a zing that wakes up your taste buds. Kinda like Sprite with a green tea aftertaste, if that makes sense?

Now, I wouldn't necessarily say it tastes exactly like Sprite, but that's not a bad thing! It's a refreshing change, and honestly, the slightly different flavor profile makes it feel less like I'm guzzling pure sugar. Plus, the fact that it packs 200mg of caffeine and zero sugar is a win in my book. Especially on days when I need an afternoon pick-me-up without crashing later.

Overall, I'm giving this a 4-star rating. It's not quite a flavor doppelganger for Sprite, but it's a tasty, energizing drink that I'll definitely be reaching for again. Just know what you're getting when you grab it - it's more fitness drink than classic soda!",4
"am i the only one that didn’t receive the flavors that was supposed to be there ? i got the coke flavor, orange, and watermelon…i only had three flavors and it wasn’t even the ones on the picture. anyways good flavors still but just not what i expected",4
"I'm going to write a review that's going to sound like I'm trolling for a second, but the shape of the cans are a bit too tall and a bit too thin. Obviously, they hold 12 FL.OZ and they don't lie about it but because they go for a sleeker design instead of the more shorter stacked cans, it makes them FAR easier to knock and tip over. Otherwise, the taste is pretty good and it seems like a healthier alternative to the more popular energy drinks.",4
"Like the drink for what it is, think the lemon lime is the better flavor as it isn’t overwhelming. I just wish it was priced a bit lower.",4
"Started buying these cases because they were more affordable than buying single in store, but when ordering directly from Amazon every can exploded like it had been shaken up the entire delivery. I don’t have that issue when ordering through Fresh.",4
"The item is great! I love this flavor but one thing is that some cans don’t have anymore gas. So they just taste like juice.",4
"Great energy drink and good flavor. Good value when the case was 15$. Now that it’s raised y’all have lost a customer.
Too bad y’all got greedy. Hopefully the market doesn’t bear it and it goes back down.
Such a shame.",4
"I love the product, but every can exploded and ran over when I opened it. every one.",4
"These are my favorite energy drinks, however the last two times I’ve ordered it seems like they’re packaged under too much pressure. Literally every single can spills all over the place when you open them. Maybe just correct that?",4
"It works, just doesn't taste like monster. You will have to embrace the unique taste. It's not grossed it's just different.I recently had the opportunity to try out the CELSIUS Peach Mango Green Tea Essential Energy Drink in a pack of 12. This functional energy drink is designed to provide a refreshing and invigorating boost to help enhance energy levels and focus throughout the day.

The Peach Mango Green Tea flavor is a delightful combination that offers a tropical and fruity taste with a hint of green tea. I found the flavor to be both unique and enjoyable, providing a pleasant and refreshing pick-me-up without being overly sweet or artificial.

What sets CELSIUS apart from other energy drinks is its unique blend of ingredients, including green tea extract, guarana seed extract, and ginger root. These ingredients work together to promote energy, focus, and metabolism, making it a functional and beneficial drink for those looking to enhance their performance and overall well-being.

I particularly appreciated the convenience of having a pack of 12 cans, making it easy to grab and go for a quick energy boost whenever needed. The sleek and attractive packaging is also eye-catching and ready for consumption or gifting.

"About 30 minutes before going to the gym I will open and start drinking a can. I definitely feel a pump of energy and it helps motivate me to get there and start my cardio routine right away. Lasts through my weightlifting sets and allows me to coast nicely through the rest of my day without feeling jittery or anxious. No crashing either.

Not sure how warranted the metabolism boosting effects are, but this along with a change in diet and working out 5-6x weekly has gotten me to lose a decent amount of excess weight and I feel like this is helping me reach my goals. Love that it is 0 calories and tastes great. Will be keeping this stocked in my fridge for sure!",5

excellent, and it’s salt, free and sugar-free and very tasty looking foward to tasting others flavors!

"I have a very active job…I started drinking celcius about 1.5 years ago. Over that time I’ve lost 40lbs, I feel fantastic and I’ve noticed the other girls at work that I’ve turned on to celcius have all had the same experience. I work overnight, so this definitely helps keep me going through long nights, after being up with my kid all day. The FIZZ FREE LEMONADE BLUE RASPBERRY is an absolute MUST TRY! Everyone I know likes different flavors…some of them I think are awful, my bestie loves. I prefer the lemonade blue raspberry, strawberry lemonade, green apple cherry is fantastic…the orange is great if you like subtle flavor. I ordered the sparkling blue raspberry and I cannot wait to try it. Lemon lime is great too! Don’t give up if you try one and don’t like it, you have to find your flavor(s). Ordering them on Amazon has saved me a lot of $$ as well. They cost $2.35 each in my area, so paying less than $2 for each is great. They arrive in a day or two with prime.",5
"Ok I am unfortunately addicted to these. I usually drink 1 and a half everyday but recently I read that all energy drinks even these can cause heart problems and other issues so I've been trying to cut down. Sometimes I drink half of one before I go workout. It definitely wakes me up and gives me a nice energy boost. I drink one when I wake up before work sometimes too. Even when I'm at home just trying not to fall asleep. Pay attention to the label, it says don't drink more than 2 a day. I can imagine being quite jittery if I drank a full 2 or more everyday.

the flavors: the variety pack came with 2 of 6 different flavors. I would've preferred 12 different flavors versus two of each but it's okay. Here's my favorite flavors from the best to worse! (grape, lemon lime, and artic frozen berry weren't in the variety pack, I bought them separate)
1. Grape
2. Orange
3. Artic frozen berry
4. wild berry
5. strawberry lemonade (wasn't a strong taste though, I'd like to try strawberry alone)
6. Kiwi Guava
7. Oasis vibe
8. Watermelon
9. Lemon lime

Grape and Orange are definitely my favorites! I was disappointed when grape wasn't in the variety pack so I bought it from a local store. Reminds me of grape soda. Some of the flavors like strawberry lemonade, watermelon and Kiwi Guava didn't really taste much like anything to me. I didn't like lemon lime at all and thought it tasted weird. I used to be a huge soda drinker before I started to eat healthy and workout, I think that's why I enjoy these so much. they're carbonated/bubbly but not a ton of calories like soda.",5
"Move over, regular energy drinks; Celsius has officially transformed me from a couch potato into a turbocharged superhero! I took a sip, and suddenly I’m convinced I could outrun a cheetah (or at least beat it in a dance-off).

After my first can, I swear I felt my sluggishness wave goodbye like a distant relative who overstayed their welcome. Forget coffee – I’ve found my new sidekick in the form of a sparkling can of pure magic.

The flavors are like a party in my mouth, and my taste buds RSVPed with a resounding “HECK YEAH!” It’s not just a beverage; it’s a flavor explosion that catapults you into a realm of tropical goodness. I’m pretty sure I heard my taste buds throw a fiesta in celebration.

But here’s the real kicker – the energy boost is smoother than a jazz sax solo. No jitters, just pure, unadulterated vitality. I’m so energized; I could probably power a small city with my newfound enthusiasm for life.

So, if you’re tired of regular old beverages and want to upgrade to “I-can-do-anything” mode, grab a Celsius. It’s the secret elixir that turned me from a mere mortal into a caffeinated superhero – cape not included. Cheers to conquering the day, one sparkling sip at a time! 🚀🎉",5
"As a energy drink “subject matter expert” as i like to call myself, i’ve had various energy drinks from all kinds of brands. Celsius has produced many flavors, some of which i totally dislike. But this Cola one, its probably my top favorites. It tastes almost like diet coke, with that energy drink “esque.” If tempted to try, i recommend you drink it COLD. Fresh out of the fridge. Otherwise, the satisfaction and overall tastyness is nonexistent. This is a drink i tend to drink within 10-30 minutes since, like regular soda, it’ll go flat and be a waste.",5
"Nespresso Capsules VertuoLine, the latest offering from the well-known coffee machine and capsule brand, has received much attention from coffee aficionados worldwide. As a coffee enthusiast, I have been keen on exploring this new system and its promises of an enhanced coffee experience. In this review, I will critically examine the VertuoLine capsules, considering factors such as taste, variety, cost, and environmental impact.

Taste and Quality:
The VertuoLine capsules are designed to be used with Nespresso's VertuoLine machines, which utilize a unique centrifugal brewing technology to extract the coffee. This process promises a richer, creamier coffee with a natural crema. While the coffee does indeed boast a smooth, full-bodied taste and a visually appealing crema, some users may find that it lacks the intense, bold flavor that traditional espresso offers.

Variety:
Nespresso has an extensive range of VertuoLine capsules, which include a wide variety of espresso, double espresso, gran lungo, coffee, and alto coffee blends. They also offer seasonal and limited-edition capsules, catering to diverse taste preferences. However, the VertuoLine capsules are not compatible with OriginalLine machines, which means users will have to invest in a new machine to enjoy the VertuoLine experience.

Cost:
One major downside of the Nespresso VertuoLine capsules is the cost. These capsules are considerably more expensive than the OriginalLine capsules and significantly pricier than traditional ground coffee. While the convenience and quality of the coffee may justify the price for some, budget-conscious consumers may find it difficult to justify the expense. The price increased at least 10% this year.

Environmental Impact:
Nespresso has made efforts to address the environmental concerns surrounding single-use coffee capsules by using aluminum, which is infinitely recyclable. The company also offers a recycling program where customers can return used capsules to Nespresso boutiques or via a pre-paid postage bag. However, despite these initiatives, the environmental impact of single-use capsules remains a concern. Consumers looking for a more eco-friendly option might consider other brewing methods that produce less waste.

Conclusion:
The Nespresso VertuoLine capsules deliver a consistent and high-quality coffee experience with a wide variety of blends to choose from. However, the elevated cost, the need for a new machine, and the environmental impact of single-use capsules may deter some potential users. While the VertuoLine capsules can be a great choice for those who prioritize convenience and variety, they may not be the best fit for everyone, especially those seeking a more traditional espresso flavor or a more sustainable brewing method.",1
"The price $$$$$ is ridiculous 🙄
I start making my own with a real coffee machine with real coffee.
Is 100 % way better .
Less contamination at the planet this is to much waste 🗑 plus those capsule are made of aluminum NOT SAFE IT ALL FOR HEALTH.👎👎👎👎👎",1
"We've used the official cups we got when we bought our machine, and they're delicious. These cups here are definitely filled with the cheapest coffee they could buy in bulk, and packaged in a way to look official. The gold one especially, is incredibly watery, and tastes like instant coffee. Buy the official cups, these will disappoint you.",1
"When I ordered the Nespresso pods - I was lead to believe I would be receiving 10 pods of each flavor listed. Totaling 30 pods. However, I now have 30 pods of the same and I'm not sure I will like them. My Nespresso machine is new to me and I want to try the various flavors available. Soooo disappointed !!",1
"I’ve ordered 2x from this supplier, the same package. The second order…. Received Jan 8th, is far inferior to the product I’m used to. It tastes like diluted coffee… visually translucent.

I decided to scale my machine and replaced the carbon filter. Tried a second cup, and same results. Packaging looks the same. I’m left here scratching my head.",1
"Something is wrong with these pods. They tasted spoiled! All 3 packages tasted bad. I question if these really came from Nepresso or perhaps they were stored wrong they were very bitter sour. I called Amazon and told them to read the recent reviews and complaints regarding this coffee. They said they will investigate. I did receive a refund and will buy directly from Nespresso instead until this is resolved.",1
"Hice la compra del café intenso y me llegó el stormio, no es malo ninguno de los dos , pero me gusta más fuerte , no hago la devolución porque ya abrí una de las cajas y la compra fue de 3 cajas . Solamente le doy una estrella porque hicieron el empaque incorrectamente. Y no es justo que uno haga la compra de un café que le gusta y le llegue otro",1
"I was a loyal Nespresso customer but stopped drinking it for six months. When I resumed delivery, the quality was noticably different. The coffee was bitter and hardly drinkable. For the price, the quality should be consistent and delicious. I will not be reordering this product!",1
"I’m very familiar with the Melozio flavor. It’s my favorite and I’ve always purchased it directly from a Nesspresso store until now…
I tried purchasing that flavor through Amazon and it tasted terrible.
The seal on top of each pod was also loose and seemed to cause issues with the machine working properly.",1
"Ordered the Melozio. I have a few pods and wondered if I was getting sick because my coffee tasted off. It turns out I was fine but the pods weren’t. They expired six months ago.",1
"I noticed when I opened them, the sleeves were the dated October 2023. I called Nespresso as advised and a very monotoned, condescending representative explained that they have a shelf for 15 months. The date I was inquiring about is on the inside of the package. She only talked, did not listen or ask any questions. After the conversation I looked on the outside of the package and I see that this was actually the production date. Very poor customer service from Nespresso by phone.",2
"So far all of the Nexpresso capsules I’ve tried have weak flavor. Such a great machine and they provide such crap coffee for it.
Seriously if I wasn’t refilling the capsules with good coffee the machine would be worthless and I’d go back to pour over.",2
"Just keep in mind when you buy that this is going to make coffee not espresso, if you want a latte you’ll need the espresso or double espresso pods. I wish that was more clear.",2
"Not to happy with these. Watery, weak, and taste almost stale. Think I will only order from actual Nespresso site. Something seems off with these.",2
"I ordered these since the review was great. However, the pack seemed old taste of the coffee was not fresh at all. Quite disappointed.",2
"Two packages have now come with improperly vacuum sealed pods and they don’t work properly. The pod on the left in the photo is a normal pod to compare the improperly sealed pods. I will say, we absolutely love these pods and really hope this problem can be resolved.",2
"How anyone can call this good coffee has never had anything except starbucks..",2
"I opened my mail box and found two boxes of Nespresso pods taped together without any padding between or around them. One box looked like it had been dropped on a corner, and I could hear the pods rattling around inside the box. When I opened the box, half of the pods were dented and the rims were bent. I straightened out the rim, put it in my machine, and pressed start. My Nespresso machine performed the initial spin up and then... nothing. It was like it did not recognize the pod. I removed that pod and tried another one that was undamaged. It did the same thing. I've never had this problem before, even with the European pods designed to brew larger cups (14-17 oz.). Not one to give up, I used a Starbucks Nespresso pods I had bought previously, and it worked perfectly. I also tried my stainless steel re-loadable pod using the coffee from the damaged pod, and it worked like a charm too. It tasted great, so flavor and freshness get 5 stars. Value for money only gets 1 star since I buy these pods for the convenience of making one cup of coffee when I don't want to make a whole pot, but cutting the pod open to get the coffee out so I can transfer it to my stainless steel pod to make a cup is not convenient by any stretch of the imagination. My overall rating for these is 2 stars, and that is just me being nice.

Update:
If you follow the link below it says, ""The only Nespresso Vertuo machine [Vertuo Next] that brews 6 sizes: coffee (5 oz, 8 oz, and 14oz), Espresso (single and double).

"I recently tried the Nespresso Capsules VertuoLine Variety Pack featuring Stormio, Odacio, and Melozio, and unfortunately, the taste did not meet my expectations. Despite the promise of medium and dark roast coffee, I found the flavors to be lacking depth and richness. The overall taste left me unsatisfied, and I may explore other options for a more enjoyable coffee experience.",2
"Too expensive for amount you get. Plus had to accept decaf which was disappointing",2
"Very expensive but cheaper than Starbucks everyday and 100% better tasting. I wish they had more variety",3
"Too expensive for what you get. A generic product would be awesome!",3
"This is great for people first getting a Nespresso machine, but I would recommend just using the flavors that they give you to determine your favorites! Save your money and get what you love, I recommend Ice Leggero and Bianco Dopio. I rarely use these flavors but it still is not bad to have just incase.",3
"Coffee is as expected - relatively dark roast with hints of chocolate. Unfortunately, the single box of 10 capsules was mailed in a plastic envelope, and it arrived crushed, damaging at least one of the capsules. These envelopes are usually ok when ordering three boxed sleeves of capsules but not appropriate for one box. This coffee, and any product really, is too expensive to lose one or two capsules through mishandling in packaging and transit.",3
"I have these on my subscribe and save every single month. These 3 flavors are so delish and foam up really nice. I do with they had another trio of flavors I could try, hence the 3 star review.",3
"4 of them are damaged and messed up and a couple are partly open…",3
"I didn't like the flavor of coffee.",3
"I ordered these product and only received one box out of three. So I called Amazon and they sent a new order. The reason for the 3 stars 😒. They tried to rip me off with just one box of 10 vs 30. So here’s the picture of the second order after calling. The coffee however is great.",3
"I’ve been ordering for years and occasionally get a defective pod. This shipment had several defective pods in each box. They still appear to work when put in machine, but watery coffee and no foam",3
"I was not very satisfied with the flavor of these three choices. Of course if you have a Nespresso machine it is very convenient to pop in a capsule, press the go button, and have a nice hot cup of coffee in a couple minutes. I am not a heavy coffee user but drink 3 cups through the day. So even with those few coffee drinks the capsule’s costs add up quickly in one month. So even though the convenience is hard to beat, the value for the money is easy to beat! I have returned to my drip coffee maker but changed to a burr grinder. I grind just before making a pot of coffee and have found a flavor that I was missing all along, which I thought I needed an espresso machine to get that, but not.",3
"I have been happy with these Vertuo pods. A few are a little light for my taste but overall quite good. A little expensive too.",4
"Love the flavor",4
"Would love to order boxes of 10 of customers choice.",4
"These are full of flavor, super fresh and can be recycled entirely!!! (But, oh, the price...) I guess for a luxury, it's a minor issue.",4
"Delicious, but a little pricey!",4
"We love the flavor very happy with that not happy with slow delivery",4
"Great for that fist
Joe in the am",4
"This rich and flavorful coffee is the only thing that gets me through my day. Use it to make any coffee, I like mine over ice. Nespresso is by far the BEST and EASIEST coffee EVER!!!!",4
"Good quality, but would like to see more generic brands come to bring overall price down.",4
"drink",4
"Ordered the 3 flavor assortment, which was promptly shipped and couldn't wait to try out the flavors. All three are pretty good, with great crema and plenty hot enough for me using a Breville machine. After trying all three flavors over the course of about 2 hours, I really didn't have an overwhelming favorite, but noticed I was feeling jittery and a bit light headed. Did some research and find that Nespresso states all of the 7.77oz capsules contain between range between 170 to 200 milligrams of caffeine per cup. So drinking three 7.77oz VertuoLine coffees means you have consumed between 510 and 600 milligrams of caffeine, and if you check, Red Bull has 111 milligrams of caffeine per 12oz can...therefore you have swallowed the equivalent of 4.5 to 5.5 cans of Red Bull! Shame on me for not looking this up in advance but I now know to limit my intake, and also have switched to the half-caf capsules which are really delicious but not as likely to over-caffeinate me!",5
"Flavor (5/5): Odacio pods bring a burst of boldness to my Nespresso experience. The rich and robust flavor profile is a delightful wake-up call for my taste buds.

Aroma (4.5/5): The aromatic experience is impressive, filling the kitchen with a tempting fragrance that signals a delicious cup of coffee brewing.

Compatibility (5/5): These pods are a perfect fit for my Nespresso machine, making the brewing process hassle-free. No mess, no fuss - just a great cup of coffee.

Versatility (5/5): Whether I need a strong shot to kickstart my morning or a bold pick-me-up in the afternoon, Odacio pods deliver a consistently satisfying coffee experience.

Affordability (4.5/5): While not the cheapest option, the quality justifies the cost. The indulgence is worth the price for coffee enthusiasts seeking a robust flavor.

Overall Impression: Odacio Pods for Nespresso are a bold and flavorful choice, delivering a consistently rich coffee experience. If you're a fan of strong, aromatic coffee, these pods are a must-try for your Nespresso machine.",5
"I’ve been a loyal Nespresso customer for years, and the VertuoLine Odacio capsules continue to impress me with their fast delivery and bold flavor.

First and foremost, Nespresso’s delivery service is second to none. Every time I order, my capsules arrive promptly, ensuring that I never run out of my favorite coffee. The convenience of having them delivered right to my door is unmatched.

As for the flavor, Odacio delivers a perfect balance of strength and mildness. The boldness of the dark roast coffee is evident with every sip, yet it’s complemented by a smooth and mellow undertone. It’s the ideal choice for those seeking a robust yet approachable cup of coffee to kickstart their day.

Overall, Nespresso VertuoLine Odacio capsules are my go-to choice for daily coffee enjoyment. With their fast delivery and satisfying flavor profile, they never disappoint. Whether you’re a seasoned coffee connoisseur or simply looking for a great daily brew, I highly recommend giving Odacio a try.",5
"Nespresso VertuoLine capsules were designed for Nespresso's VertuoLine coffee machines. These machines are unique because they use a patented Centrifusion technology to brew both coffee and espresso. Here are some common points:

Pros:
Convenience: Nespresso machines, in general, are praised for their convenience. The VertuoLine capsules, in particular, are known for their ease of use. You simply insert the capsule, press a button, and the machine takes care of the rest.

Variety: Nespresso offers a wide variety of coffee blends and flavors in their VertuoLine capsules. This variety allows users to explore different tastes and find the one that suits their preference.

Consistency: Users often mention the consistency in taste. Once you find a flavor you like, you can expect a similar taste every time you brew a cup.

Quality of Coffee: Many users appreciate the quality of coffee produced. While it might not match the complexity of freshly ground, high-end coffee beans brewed with a manual method, it's often regarded as superior to instant coffee.

Speed: Nespresso machines are known for their speed. You can get a cup of coffee or espresso in a matter of seconds, making them ideal for busy mornings.

Cons:
Cost: One major point of contention is the cost of the capsules. Nespresso capsules are more expensive per cup compared to traditional ground coffee or even some other single-serve pod systems.

Environmental Concerns: The capsules are typically made of aluminum, which is recyclable, but the recycling process might not be accessible or convenient for everyone. This has been a significant point of concern for environmentally conscious consumers.

Limited Customization: If you prefer to finely tune every aspect of your coffee brewing process, a Nespresso machine might feel limiting. The machines are designed for simplicity, which sacrifices some options for customization.

Dependency on Capsules: You're tied to using Nespresso's proprietary capsules. If you prefer to use freshly ground coffee from a local roaster, for instance, this system might not be the best choice.

Noise: Some users find Nespresso machines to be noisier compared to other brewing methods.",5
"These mild roast Nespresso pods have quickly become my morning favorite. The flavor is smooth and well-balanced, with just the right touch of brightness to start the day. Despite being a mild roast, each cup brewed has a rich aroma and a satisfying depth of flavor, without any bitterness.

I've found these pods perfect for when I want a gentler coffee experience, yet still desire that full, rounded taste. They work seamlessly in my Nespresso machine, producing a consistently good cup every time.

The convenience and quality of these pods are remarkable. For anyone who enjoys a milder coffee but doesn't want to compromise on taste, these Nespresso pods are an excellent choice. Highly recommend!",5
"I live my Nespresso VirtroLine beverage maker. Every time I make a brew I am transported to Italy. Finding the right flavors is important because the pods arent cheap! I find some of the pods too bitter. This is my most favorite flavored pod that I order over and over. I find the flavor bright and rich and not too bitter.",5
"I don’t like different notes in my coffee, so this is just perfect for me. It’s strong enough and very tasty. I look forward to mornings just to drink this lol 😆",5
"We purchased the Nespresso VertuoLine just after my daughter was born in 2019. We needed a faster way to make a delicious cup of coffee, as we are super coffee snobs, but not big fans of some of the other competitive quick cup makers on the market.
We received a sample pack of some of the pods, and the Melozio was just the best of the best. The warm, nutty tones with rich and slightly caramel-ly notes is exactly the flavor profile we need for our morning boost and is very comparable to a freshly pulled espresso.
We subscribe and save to this and happily receive our little box every 2 weeks.",5
"I've purchased this from amazon now 7 times. These flavors are a perfect balance if you need to change up your coffee every now and then. I've purchased from Nespresso's website but recently have only been purchasing from amazon since I don't have to meet a minimum spend for free shipping.",5
"I am a first time user to this coffee maker and found that I enjoy using the pods ordered. Pods have great taste and just the correct amount is made each time.",5
"Update February 2024

I've had this happen now a couple of times, not just a one off. If you don't like gross, turn away now.

.
.

The last two orders of these premier protein shakes are either bad batches from the maker or a storage issue.
There I was happily enjoying my cereal, when I feel something weird in my mouth, the cereal and protein drink that I'm using as a milk substitute.. and there's this slimy string hanging off my lips and another thing in the cereal bowl that looks like a worm. After getting over my initial disgust, I looked at the ""worms"" further. They look like congealed milk that was stuck to the bottom of the bottles(they had the same rounded edges as the bottle base). These usually have some protein powder that never quite get dissolved, this was not the cause of the worms.
*""Product is not eligible for return.

Currently I'm out close to $60 between the 2 bad batches.

I'll be using protein powder from now on and either a blender bottle or a NutriBullet to do the mixing myself, The extra hassle is worth not wasting money and most importantly not drinking curdled milkworms.

++Original review ++
A friend of mine sent these to me as a gift after they worked for her mother. I had a stint in the hospital and after getting out there with some rough going with my appetite. Muscle loss was a huge concern, as was keeping inflammation down. These have almost no sugar in them, and a very small amount of sodium.. sugar and sodium being major contributors to inflammation.
I used to drink two a day, now I use one for my cereal daily as a milk substitute.

If you're not as concerned about sodium content, I can highly recommend the peanut butter and chocolate, and the caffee latte as well.

Couple things to note:
The outer covering you have to rip off from the lid goes all the way down to the bottom of the bottle, and it can break a little early, it can also continue all the way down the bottle. Just expect it to do that about 50% of the time.

Also, as is the case with most drinks of this nature I take a sip of it, then put the lid back on and shake it up really well. Otherwise the protein powder or whatever it is that they use gets congealed and stuck at the bottom.

I don't know why, but the bottled version of this tastes way better than the box version. You'll know what I'm talking about if you already get them from Walmart or Costco.. those come in a boxy version that for some reason can sometimes have a petroleum taste (which I'm guessing comes from the container, since I've yet to experience that taste in any of the plastic bottle versions).",1
"I was originally happy to find these online, and that I could order as a subscription because finding the cookies and cream version of Premier Protein in stores can sometimes be a hassle. That said when these came in I threw them in the fridge immediately and later when they were cold I popped one open and immediately noticed that they that for some reason these ones tasted thinner. I also kept noticing thin goopy layers of protein hitting my tongue which I have never experienced before over the years of buying this product. I came to the conclusions that these are either a different product being sold as the same thing, or that these ones in the plastic containers dont properly store the product like the cardboard like containers do from the ones I usually buy at the store. I stopped drinking them right away though and it sucks because its a waste. Canceled my subscription and I guess I just need to keep trying my luck at the stores.",1
"The shakes have been coagulated with stringy floating thick amorphous strings of white filling the shakes and that’s after heavy shaking. I was your number one customer. Technically I gotta be up there still. So the shakes especially cookies and cream have had this problem now the last 3 months. Prior 3 months were great. Now coagulation problem is becoming a really gross experience of something I once loved. What the heck have they done to change it into this globular beverage. It’s like chunky white strings throughout the bottles. I’ve ordered cases upon cases. My dad confirmed the same thing brought it up to me without my mentioning. So this was not confirmation bias based. And he never complains at stuff I like especially that we both like bc he doesn’t want to hurt my feelings ever. He’s the best that way. But this disturbed him enough to ask what was going on with it. Bc him and I both would and do drink them religiously. Manufacturer or ingredients or storage needs to be changed and you guys need to product test to make sure you’re not month after month sending this stringy coagulated gump and taking my money in return for undrinkable dubious curd-like string shakes.",1
"I've ordered 3 times before with no issue; I love this shake. Right up until my last box. The first bottle I took a good gulp of and then wanted to vomit from a disgusting vaguely metallic and off taste that's was like something died in it or had gone completely rancid with a rotten flavor. I did not get sick from it and I chalked it up to one bad bottle. The second bottle smelled fine so I decided on a small sip. Nope. It was the same. I also didn't get sick from it so hopefully it's just completely disgusting in a non listeria/salmonella type of way. So sad. I'm terrified to buy ever again.",1
"So I've been drinking Protein Premier since October 2022. I found it as a great source of vitamins. In April 2023, I drank Protein Premier and noticed a weird taste. I took picture of what i saw from the bottle which looked like worms. I called to report this back to Protein Premier who said they would refund me the bottles that I drank. No follow up was ever done. In Feb 2024, I have sever bloating, itchiness, and diarrhea. I've noticed weird stools since Aug 2023, but never questioned. Now, I find out that I have worms which stumped my doctor because this should not be happening. Becareful with this product. The pics that I provide are a little graphic , but be warned that worms are in these drinks. Since I've been diagnosed with worms, I will never touch this protein drink ever.",1
"I buy these usually at Costco or Sam’s so these bottles were new for me. I didn’t expect it to be different but boy was I wrong. I have texture issues so in my first sip I gagged and cannot drink any more of the bottles. I got a mouth full of chunky nasty blobs. Best way to explain is like spoiled milk texture. I was so disappointed! especially with how much I had to pay for these compared to Sam’s or Costco and now have to throw them all away. I did try another bottle and it was the same thing so it wasn’t just one. And yes I shook them before. It looks like it’s just around the neck of the bottle but that’s the best picture I could get to show the kind of globs. I removed them and still got some throughout the bottle!",1
"I had the misfortune of accidentally tasting a shake that had gone bad. I add these to my iced coffee and my husband didn’t realize that these are not supposed to smell like actual feces. So far 2 out of the package I bought have been spoiled. The darker one in the picture on the left is the spoiled one. We now are inspecting each bottle before use and saving the labels of the rotten drinks. We’re traumatized by the stink, and I by the taste. I won’t be purchasing again.

This was the cookies n cream flavor btw.",1
"I LOVED this product. I had it setup on subscribe and save. Chocolate and Cafe Latte were my favorites. But then I started noticing there were chunks in the bottles. I tried shaking and shaking to get it mixed but these are hard and do not blend. It is almost like curdled milk. Yes, it tastes ok but the ick factor makes me throw the bottle away. It has gotten so bad that EVERY bottle has chunks. I’m bummed because I have 4 cases of the stuff and it sucks! Yes, I guess I could strain the shakes since it is most likely an ingredient that wasn't blended well but who wants to do that? I got these for taste and convenience. It’s time to find something else. :(",1
"First of all, I have been purchasing premier protein vanilla for years, and I will continue to purchase it. I use it in my morning coffee. Love most of the flavors!
But this batch is gross with slime and blobs. I didn't know they didn't offer refunds for the Premier protein. I shouldn't be stuck with a slimy blobby gunk product, because I got a bad batch from Amazon. I didn't realize there were no returns. This review is not about the product, but about the issue of no refunds or replacements for a bad product. When I had a thick,gross product a few years ago I took it back to the store and they issued a replacement. Never ordering premier protein from Amazon after this!",1
"You know when milk sits for too long and you get the ring of crusty milk at the top. Well, that is what it is like. Then to top it off, part of it come off and is was like a worm in your mouth that is still partially stuck to the bottle. So there it is dangling from the bottle staring me in the eye. But that wasn’t the worst. The chunks in my mouth much like curdled milk triggered a gag reflex that almost resulted in projectile commuting in the gym. Lesson learned don’t buy premade protein from Amazon. They most likely sell stuff that is closer to expiration dates than store do. I’m sure this stuff has a shelf life of a few years.",1
"I used this product almost daily for a year and the first couple of months I really enjoyed everything about it. From the 100 mg of caffeine which was a nice little boost in the morning or before working out. The 30g of protein. And the taste, which after getting cold in the fridge or pouring over ice was good. HOWEVER. I started receiving them with a stringy, sludgy ring around the top under the cap which was off putting. I did research and found out a stringy or wormy substance in a Premier Protein shake could be the protein powder or concentrate settling out of the water. FINE. I couldn’t stomach drinking the stringy goo so I just wiped it out with a paper towel before drinking. A couple more months later I started getting some that really started to smell bad and have even more string sludge on the bottom and in the drink itself aswell. I then would start to receive random flavors that I never even ordered instead of cafe latte. With everything added up I decided it was enough and ditched the product. I now use core power which has 42G of protein and have had 0 problem with sludge (even the reviews are pretty consistent of not having any) and taste very good. All in all, if you can pay a little more money to try and avoid these negatives I say do it. It’s worth it.",2
"With a name like pumpkin spice I, perhaps, mistakenly, envisioned a pumpkin pie tasting beverage, or at least more of a pumpkin flavor. It was just spice. I really did not detect pumpkin. The peaches and cream is great and I would love to try the strawberry and cream but it is never in stock. I went with this for some variety. Disappointed in the result. If you like spices, not hit, just spiced, go for it, if you like pumpkin, maybe look elsewhere for your fix.",2
"I drink several different flavors of premier protein, including pumpkin. However, this order of pumpkin has been awful. Every single bottle is full of stringy, worm like coagulated bits. It's incredibly gross and a horrible waste of money. Undrinkable with slimy bits in it. Not sure if it was stored or shipped improperly but its awful. I don't think I will be ordering again as it's pricey and I can't trust it will arrive drinkable.",2
"I’ve been drinking the cafe latte and chocolate premier protein shakes for years and never had a problem until recently. I don’t know what’s going on at the manufacturing plant that’s causing all these chunks but I’ve had them in the café latte and the chocolate varieties. Where you purchase them from doesn’t matter because I’ve had this same issue with shakes purchased from Costco and Walmart as well as Amazon. Time to find another brand sadly.",2
"I’ve always loved PP but the last two packages I got (vanilla and caramel) have a gross film inside the bottle and on the bottom - even if I shake extremely well. It doesn’t melt into my coffee either it just falls to the bottom and then I will get it in my last sip and it’s effing disgusting. This will be my last time purchasing unfortunately after years of being a loyal customer.",2
"I bought the cafe latte as I am a coffee lover, but I find the flavor and smell of this flavor to be absolutely horrible. It smells something old or bad or rotten. I know that protein shakes can sometimes have a weird flavor to them, but I have never had something taste this bad. I have to plug my nose to drink it or mix it with another drink in order to cover up the taste. It leaves a horrible aftertaste in your mouth as well. I do want to try a different flavor as I like the convenience and thickness of the protein shakes but I will never buy the cafe latte flavor ever again.",2
"Every single one of these bottles had an undissolved rubbery clump in it. I even tried to dissolve it by putting it in a blender but nope. Will never buy these again. I subsequently bought the premiere protein version with the Energy and immune nutrients in it. Costs a little more but it doesn’t have the rubbery blobs in it. Skip this version.",2
"Get four boxes of these delivered every month. Great for post-workout or for supplementing macros in general. Usually good but not necessarily consistent. Last box came and taste was off, like somewhat sour with a mild odor. Tried my third shake now and they all have the same problem with no option for a refund. Will have to throw out and hope my next set of boxes doesn’t have the same problem

Edit: next set of boxes came and it had the same problem. After reading some other recent reviews this seems to be a problem other people are experiencing as well. Appears the product has dropped off in quality. Canceled my subscription and will now be looking for another protein shake",2
"I ordered the strawberry flavor and there is a strawberry on the bottle but it is definitely not strawberry that’s why such a low rating. I have it and it isn’t cheap, so I have to drink it. I was buying Ensure strawberry and that definitely was strawberry. My primary care physician recommended the Premier drink that’s why I came to Amazon.",2
"I love the Premiere Protein shakes, but these bottled versions that are sold on Amazon are noticeably worse than the boxed versions I buy in stores. The bottles have consistently worse flavor, weird stringy plastic like pieces floating in them, and I actually got a full case of the chocolate recently that was rancid even though the date was good. Not only do the bottled shakes taste worse than the paper boxes, but they’re also much more annoying to open.

Stick to the boxed version! I wish Amazon would sell those instead. I straight up am done buying the bottles. They’re too inconsistent with their quality.",2
"I picked these up after stomach surgery. These do not use protein isolate and as a result have lactose. If you are sensitive to lactose these are not for you. Look for protein isolate products, not just protein.

Protein drinks and protein isolate drinks are both popular supplements used by athletes, fitness enthusiasts, and individuals looking to increase their protein intake. The primary difference between the two lies in the type and concentration of protein they contain.

1. Protein Drinks:
Protein drinks, often labeled as protein shakes, can contain various sources of protein, such as whey, casein, soy, or a blend of different proteins. These drinks may also contain carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals, and other additives. Protein drinks are designed to provide a convenient and quick way to consume protein, and they are often used as meal replacements or post-workout recovery drinks. The protein content in these drinks can vary widely, and they may not have as high a protein concentration as protein isolate drinks.

2. Protein Isolate Drinks:
Protein isolate drinks are made from protein isolates, which are highly refined forms of protein that have undergone additional processing to remove the majority of fats, carbohydrates, and other non-protein components. Whey protein isolate and soy protein isolate are common types. These drinks are characterized by their high protein content, often containing 90% or more protein by weight. Protein isolate drinks are popular among those who want to minimize their intake of fats and carbohydrates while maximizing their protein intake. They are often chosen by athletes and bodybuilders during periods of intense training or when following specific dietary protocols.

In summary, the main difference between protein drinks and protein isolate drinks is the protein content and the level of refinement. Protein drinks can contain a variety of proteins and other nutrients, while protein isolate drinks are specifically focused on delivering a high concentration of protein with minimal additional components.",3
"First off I LOVE the chocolate flavor of these, nothing negative to say there (the protein to calorie ratio on any flavor of these is awesome!). But the respective star ratings on this review are specifically for the bananas & cream one.

I thought the bananas & cream flavor sounded good but didn't realize that it was going to be similar to the Gros Michel banana flavor, i.e. like banana-flavored candy which doesn't taste the same as the common Cavendish bananas most people eat. (Apparently there's a grain of salt to be taken with that theory about banana-flavored candy, but regardless, most people will know what I mean here.) Since it's a mass-produced packaged drink, I should have suspected it honestly, but alas. I personally am not a fan of that type of banana flavor at all, however they're still drinkable and I'll get through this pack. Then I'll go back to my chocolate ones.

I was nervous about straying from what I know & like and I was NOT rewarded lol.",3
"I am subscribed to receive a box of these every 2 weeks, for the most part they are great. good proteins and an extra kick in the morning so I don't need a coffee, but every once in a while there is a brown mucus that is stuck on the bottom of the bottle. After shaking it and then drinking your now picking it out of your teeth and it is GROSS. I am not sure if I got a bad batch, but i just got a new box 2 days ago and I am 2 for 2 being bad. This morning I left about 1/5 of the bottle as it was mostly floaties in it So I threw it away. hopefully this isn't an ongoing thing or I will be canceling",3
"The Premier Protein was in a seperate box within a larger box that also included a book. I e of the bottles of protein drink had a broken seam which leaked the protein drink all over the other bottles and the box, as well as onto the book and the larger box, making it hard to get open because the sticky chocolate drink had partially dried. The bottom edge of the book was also covered in the chocolate protein drink which had dried. I can still read the book but pages are stuck together and some pages tear when I try to separate them. Big mess to clean up! I didn't take pictures because I put the messy boxes in the trash right away.",3
"I really wanted to like this one. I was disappointed when I had the first one. To me it has a chalky taste. I love all the other flavors I have tried. This one is not one I would buy again.",3
"A string of ""something"" that looked like skin was in 3 of the 12 bottles that was purchased. Although the chocolate drink had a good flavor, the substance was a gross turnoff. Not sure I can recover! Yuck!",3
"I did not like this drink.Im not a real chocolate lover.but I was able to mix it with my coffee. If you love chocolate, this is for you.Not a lot of peanut butter taste to me.",3
"This particular bottle is not good. There are chunks of something in there. I couldn’t drink a whole one. But the othe bottles is ok. I drink it every day.",3
"Good product overall.

Disappointing to note coagulated product at the top of the container and in the lid. Even shaking well does not disperse the build up.

Noted on subscription ordering product expire dates are within 6 months but in stores like Costco or Sam's product sold is good for one year?

Seems like subscription shopping gets you old product sent even if still inside expire date, build up in opening and lid show aging.

Price is higher even with discount for subscription. Not good choice given product quality at presumably 6 months of shelf life.

I have cancelled my subscription.",3
"has a slight chemical taste, but not as bad as some of the other flavors of this product. It has a low potassium content, which is important to me.",3
"Overall, the taste of these was pretty good. Not too chalky. I bought a 12 pack of the 11.5oz bottles, and some of them had stringy things in them - even after shaking them up. Once I took a few sips, I was able to shake it up more, and the problem seemed to stop. But some of the pieces were kinda big, and made me gag. Also, if you shook them up too much, they got pretty frothy.

I liked the Walmart brand of the same kind a lot more.",4
"One would think that a drink labeled as a ""Protein"" drink and low sugar would not cause issues for diabetics. However, I have now been drinking these for nearly 3 months and determined that I have to take extra insulin after drinking this liquid protein drink and it still spikes my blood glucose levels over 200 mg/dL. I like the taste (or I should say can tolerate the taste) and the texture is just fine. But I will be looking at BOOST Glucose Control Max next. I will review them after another 1 to 2 months too. Bottom line: Drinks are good for most but for some diabetics (like me) they will raise your blood glucose levels much higher then you would expect due to the artificial sweetener ""Acesulfame Potassium"" present in these drinks. Who knew that even the ""fake"" sweeteners can cause issues too.",4
"cheaper price at costco
I believe this is the only flavor (caffe latte) with an equivalent of 1 cup of coffee's caffeine.
this is probably the most universally amenable flavor if you're iffy and not sure if you want this particular flavor.
a thin film of gunk will form at the top inside of the container in a ring which will get into your drink so open the container first and clean it off with a tissue before you shake it.
it does not blend super well with other things - i tried to put it in a blender to add some spinach etc and it got VERY frothy. just drink it separately",4
"Going back 9-10 years, a co-worker had weight loss surgery and drank the chocolate version a lot. I'm not crazy about chocolate (in general), but tried a little of hers; I didn't like it enough to buy it. I wanted to like Premier Protein because they were 30g of protein.
The other disadvantage is the sweetener used, but I was buying another very well known brand with same sweetener and a coffee flavor, but only 15g PRO.
**I've been buying Premier Cafe Late since it came out and love it. I WISH they would make a STEVIA version that wasn't quite so sweet or just unsweetened, but I still drink at least one and deal with the sweetener issues.
I need more protein so I drink this early and make others for later in the day, from a brand sweetened with stevia. I love these pre-made, but I just have to make the others. 🤷‍♀️",4
"I really like the cafe latte flavor and have been drinking these shakes after every workout for almost a year. I would usually get the carton package from the grocery store but last month i decided to order the bottle version and the taste is exactly the same but there are ‘strings’ inside the bottle that literally make me gag whenever i try to sip the shake. Even after aggressively shaking the bottle, the strings won’t dissolve and i end up chugging it so i won’t have to feel them in my mouth.",4
"Enjoyed the drink, first thing in the morning I don’t eat breakfast so I drink a premier protein. I like most of the flavors na couple I did not try as of yet.",4
"I bought both the chocolate and vanilla protein drinks. The vanilla is a good option for me, but for some reason it has parts that have settled more. Even after I shake it well, when I drink it, little harder pieces of the film that sits on top of the settled drink never mix up again and I get these thin lumps
when drinking it. I really don't like it. The texture of these are not appealing. I also have some, still in the rim of the bottle after drinking it all. I love that these come in a bottle instead of a carton though.",4
"The only thing I didn't like was that despite shaking the bottle till bubbles filled the volume, it had little stringy lumps around the lid and down at the bottom, which kind of grossed me out. I can handle banana strings when peeling a real banana, but they have no business being in a milkshake. Other than that they are fine.",4
"This is very, very filling and does not lend itself to gulping down. The taste is better than others that I have tried. At 160 calories it is not as calorically dense as others. Price is about the same as other brands.",4
"I craved these during fall season and they hit the spot. Very nutritional. The only draw back is they expire quickly, and should not be drank after that date. It was clumpy and didn't mix after shaking it up.",4
"This is the Premier Protein Shake, Café Latte flavor. I've bought it repeatedly, and I always buy the 12-packs.

Major plus points for me:
* 30g Protein. One of the highest protein amounts you can get in a prepared shake for a decent enough price.
* Only 1 gram of total sugar and 0 added sugars while also low-fat with only 3 grams fat, 1 gram of that being saturated. Often when something is advertised as low carb/sugar, it will have extra fat and low-fat usually means more added sugars because companies do this to improve/balance taste. This product is low on both and thus, makes a great meal replacement if you'd like to lose weight or stay lean while also tasting fantastic.
* Each container is 11 oz/325 ml, which is also the recommended serving size, and this protein shake provides a great protein to weight ratio at only 160 calories per serving.
* Again, great taste, both chilled and at room temperature -- hear me out 😅. I suffer from chronic pain in my joints and it takes a while for my pain killers to kick in -- but I want my coffee/caffeine sooner than that. My fridge is downstairs and stairs are hard on me, first thing in the morning. Most of these protein shakes do not taste the same when at room temperature. This one DOES! It's as sweet as you'd expect from a Mocha and smooth as any coffee from your local coffee shop (not grainy or mealy at all). So, I don't have to keep it in the fridge and avoid extra pain that would come with retrieving it from downstairs.
* One serving/container has the same caffeine that would be in a cup of coffee -- perfect as I drink it within 30 mins of waking up, rather than just coffee.
* It has 24 vitamins and minerals, which makes me worry a bit less about taking vitamins separately (a quarter of daily recommended amounts) and adds to this protein shake's nutritional value.
* This is a gluten-free product if you can trust the labeling.
* SNAP/EBT-eligible item.

Downsides:
* Allergens: milk, soy
* Potentially problematic ingredients:
The shake has artificial flavoring, high oleic sunflower/soybean oils, phosphates used as preservatives, inulin, and sucralose. So if you want to avoid any of there, you might want to choose a different product.
* Price: All proteins have become so expensive, it's difficult to find a good product that hits all the healthy points without problem ingredients. With this as with similar protein shakes, I sometimes have to skip my purchase or switch to another brand sometimes because I have a fixed budget.

Overall:
One of the better protein products out there. True high protein, low carb AND low-fat. Gluten-free. Great taste and texture/consistency. A lot of benefits. Price could be better but this is also SNAP/EBT-eligible, which is a plus. There are some questionable ingredients but they're also in the majority of high-protein products, in general. The shake does contain the known allergens milk and soy, so IF you're allergic to either, do NOT buy this. Other than that, great product and highly recommended.",5
"This is one of the better ready-to-drink vanilla shakes I've tried.
They sometimes seem a little over-creamy, noticable when you finish, and there's a lump left in the bottle, but maybe that's what it takes to make it taste this good.

As well as the 30g of protein, these are loaded with vitamins & minerals, making them one of the healthier drinks I buy.",5
"I bought this to try an lose some weight while boosting my immune health. The quality of taste is amazing. It’s not too thin it’s not too thick. The chocolate is my favorite. I love that it’s low calorie intake and less than 1g sugar while providing 24 vitamins & nutrients and 30g of protein.

It’s great for on the go and curbs your appetite in between meals. I drink it every morning and each night.

I haven’t noticed an odor at all. It’s great value for the money. If you love chocolate milk you’ll love this one!",5
"I am an elderly woman who is suffering from kidney and heart issues. I don't have much appetite, so also losing muscle like crazy. I am looking like all those other wrinkly, skinny old people I said I wouldn't. So my doctor said high protein shakes. Okay.
So I started researching. Because of price and ratings I started with a couple 4-pks of Premier from a local grocery outlet. Cafe latte...Yum! Then I went to Amazon to get regular deliveries because I no longer drive. Read lots of reviews. I noticed some mentions of outlets besides Amazon. I also noticed a link to 'Premier Store'. Given the bad reviews re slime and expiration dates, I carefully made sure I wasn't ordering through an outside source. Don't know if that actually helped, but I have not had any of those issues out of 180+. Although, to make sure on the slime, I open a bottle before shaking and check inside the neck, to wipe it out if suspicious. Then re-cap and shake, shake, shake. (One could also pour through a fine strainer and/or cheesecloth to not waste it.)
Besides Cafe Latte, I have tasted Peaches and Cream, Vanilla, and Strawberries and Cream. None if these are strong flavored, but I can taste the chocolate and coffee in my favorite. The Vanilla is refreshing, as is the Peaches and Cream (which has a delicate peach flavor). The Strawberries and Cream is cooling and not untasty, just not much flavor. And I have added Bananas and Cream, which is also nice but mild.
One more issue: digestive issues.
Some people's innards don't like the soy and some other ingredients. Others are more forgiving. I get some bloat but the benefit I receive outweighs any mild discomfort. Just because some people can't tolerate this product doesn't mean it's bad.
My last note...lead. Lead is bad. But I have been around lead for many decades, from leaded gasoline polluting roadside blackberries (oh, no!) to lead in paint for all kinds of things. It hasn't had much impact on me (that I know of) and I am not giving these to anyone else, so, in the meantime, whatever life I have left will not be spent worrying about it. Granted, you younger people and children do need to be cautious.
Ain't it fun?

UPDATE: 23 Oct 2023
1. To start, the shakes I get are shipped in thick, heavy-duty boxes in which the shakes are closely and firmly packed and the company name and other pertinent info is printed on the outside. If yours isn't you could have issues from an outside vendor, such as expiry dates and improper storage, not to mention higher prices.
2. Regarding the slime and stomach issues, they appear to be caused by the same ""problem""--- the protein. While some flavor have two types of condensed (is that the word I want?) milk proteins combined.. Some have soy. The proteins sometimes separate a bit causing the slime. My suggestion above still holds.
And, I'm sorry to say, the stomach issues are also caused by the milk proteins and lactose. Over 60% of Americans suffer from some level of lactose intolerance (not allergy); an individual's level of intolerance will determine how bad you feel.
Jeeze!
Finally, recycling the bottles: Rinse and zip off the cover which is discarded. Done. BUT if you live in either Oregon (me) or Maine you have the option to redeem the bottles for 10 cents if the portion of cover stating that is still attached. Granted it's not a lot, but it builds.
(Oregon is in the middle of the Cascade Subduction Zone ... Inevitable massive earthquake...when, not if. So I am donating my $6 a month to our CERT I program to buy supplies. )
The choice is yours.
Now I'm done! Have a healthy life.",5
"This Pumpkin Spice Protein shake has everything in it for your health needs. I bought this protein supplement because I had a pressure wound. It has 30 grams of protein compared to the other shakes that have only about 12 to 16 grams of protein. I keep it cold and then I shake it vigorously before I drink it. I think it tastes delicious; however, I did notice some residual substance at the bottom of the bottle. When I shake it longer it usually dissolves. I would recommend this protein supplement to anyone in need of extra protein and who would like a tasty drink.",5
"This past year, I've gone on a health journey. I've started intermittent fasting and counting calories. These protein shakes have been crucial in my weight loss regimen. I cannot stress how delicious these are while also being full of protein. This is my favorite flavor and I love the bottle shape. It makes it so easy to consume the entire bottle. The square cartons cause you to not be able to drink everything. These bottles don't have that issue. For that reason alone, I've probably purchased this specific flavor through Amazon close to 20 times, maybe more.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",5
"I normally buy these at Walmart but I noticed that Amazon had them on special for $19.99. That was such a great price that I bought a box. These are the best tasting protein shakes you can ever buy. . They are delicious! I do feel that they are highly priced and that was why I purchased them on Amazon had a special on them",5
"I absolutely love premier protein. I tell everyone I know how much I love their shakes lol but this flavor is my absolute favorite. I stopped drinking coffee a while ago but I seriously love it and I missed it terribly. This shake has a great flavor and also gives me a boost of caffeine! Now I don’t even crave coffee anymore which is a huge win for me personally. I feel so great since adding premier protein shakes to my daily routine and even if this flavor isn’t right for you I can pretty much guarantee they’ve got a flavor you’ll be obsessed with too!",5
"I am a big fan of Premier Protein Shakes, but I definitely prefer the tetra pak version with the twist tops. These bottle versions with the plastic wrap and twist top are kind of a pain.
PRO TIP TO AVOID SLIMYS AND CHUNKS! (Bottle version of Chocolate)
Mine usually go straight from the box into the fridge. Sometime they are stored upright, sometimes sideways. BEFORE you drink one from the fridge, DO NOT SHAKE JUST YET! Keep the bottle upright and unwrap the plastic and twist open the top. The slimy stuff or chunks are usually in the inner cap or around the mouth of the bottle. Grab a paper towel or kleenex to wipe out the inner cap and mouth of the bottle. Then put the cap back on and give it a good shake. I am not sure if it is how they are stored or where the congealed stuff forms, but once you wipe them from the inner cap you can shake and shake with out drinking slimy chunks. Hope this helps!",5
"This is my favorite brand of protein drink because it actually tastes good as well as being good for you. While I can get it at BJs and perhaps other stores, they are usually limited to just a couple of flavors and I never know which ones they will have on hand. I like to order it online because I can be assured of getting the flavors I want without shopping around. Plus it is delivered quicker than I can get to the stores sometimes.",5
"I bought 2 Stanley cups at the same time for my Grand Girls, One is holding up, this one leaks! Because it leaks, her teacher ask that she not use it at school in her class! That is what my 7 year old wanted it for, to show it off! I bought this cup not even 2 months ago, and it leaks, being it was 2 months ago, they will not replace it! 35! And in 2 months it leaks! That shows me the poor Quality of these very expensive cups! Stanley you should be ashamed of yourself for not replacing this cup! My grand girls were so surprised when these cups arrived at there home, a special gift from their Grammy! they can only take it to cheer, and one can use it a school, that how special they are to them! For that price, it’s a shame, that this one leaks! I myself bought one a Walmart, 6 months ago, for 9.99! It does not leak, it’s has hit the ground several times, tossed in my car, so for 9.99 it is holding up better then this 35.00 Stanley! It also comes in many pretty colors, has a lid that can be used 3 different ways, and my Grand Girls have designed it for me! Being a Grammy, I don’t need a 35 dollar cup that leaks, but to a 7 and 8 year old, the STANLY, was very important to them, just to see the joy on their faces and the excitement, and surprise to get a package in their name, , when I had it delivered to their home, was well worth the over priced STANLY mug! It just sucks one can’t bring it to school, and can’t be used as intended for my 7 year old!",1
"My ""tweenage"" daughter recently used some of her Christmas money to buy a large Stanley tumbler. The tumbler arrived promptly and was all she was hoping for, but shortly after receiving her cup we heard reports that Stanley cups contain led. I thought this must be a malicious rumor, but since led is highly toxic, I ordered a test kit to double check her cup. We used a swab kit purchased through Amazon and checked the inside of the cup. Much to our dismay, the test clearly showed led on the inside of the cup. We were completely shocked! Now it is too late for us to send the cup back through Amazon, but we cannot use the cup. I have tried to warn friends and family to check, but most don't believe me or seem to care, which is very surprising. I'm putting a general warning out to all who may have purchased a Stanley tumbler, please led test your cup before using. This is no longer just a rumor, but is being reported by major news stations as well. Also, Amazon should allow buyers to return their contaminated products past the normal return dates since this is a serious health hazard.",1
"My husband purchased this “Stanley” cup for me for Christmas thinking it was the real deal. It is not. I purchased one for him elsewhere and there are stark differences. The cup I received from Amazon came with paint in random spots and a ding. I looked passed it, because I was excited. Then I noticed the handle is not in the correct position on the cup, it is an inch below the silver. The screws are also not the correct ones. They are philips head style. Lastly the lid. The lid is made of cheap plastic. It broke within a couple weeks of use. It was impossible to remove, I had to ask my husband to do it any time I wanted water. The little piece that the straw goes through doesn’t even fit, it pops up all the time. As you can imagine. I am not happy with this product.",1
"I’ve been anxiously awaiting my Stanley delivery and as soon as I pulled it out of the box my son says, “You know there’s lead in that, right?”. No, I didn’t know that. So I looked it up. And yes, there’s definitely lead.

According to an article published on February 1, 2024 by The New York Times:

*A Stanley representative referred to the explanation on the company’s website describing the use of lead in the cups. But in a statement to NBC News, a representative said, “Our engineering and supply chain teams are making progress on innovative, alternative materials for use in the sealing process.”*

Does this mean everyone who purchased a tumbler will be getting a new one free of charge?

This is a huge shame, Stanley. You’ve been in business for over 100-years. We expected more out of you.",1
"Update: I threw the item away after taking a photo of the busted handle. Stanley will not warranty the item because I don't have a photo of the bottom. So I spent $50 on a glorified gas station coffe mug that is not being warrantied by either companies. Don't waste your money!

This was Christmas gift and last weekend the handle completely separated from the mug. I have not gotten a reply from the company. I can't Amazon immediately and was told return had closed but I'd receive a replacement due to the damage. Fast forward 1 wk later, no new mug and a different Amazon rep told me to basically suck it up I wasn't getting any refund or replacement. He was sure to apologize for the broken promise- like that helps. Anyone else DONE with Amazon customer service or lack of recently???",1
"If I could give a zero I would!! This was my first Stanley and I was very excited to receive the Rose Quartz I had ordered. It was packed nicely. I was for sure this could not be a dupe. BUT upon close inspection it was a indeed a fake!

The logo was too dark.
The handle was too low.
The lid was not flushed to the rim.
The sticker on the box and cup was incorrect did not match cup that was ordered.
The rubber on the handle and lid DID NOT match.
The color on the handle did not match the cup it was slightly different but nonetheless NOT the correct color.

I went to Academy to do a comparison AND lo and behold it was confirmed this cup is NOT a REAL Stanley!",1
"I bought the Stanley just to see what the hype was. I mean, $45 on a freaking cup, there's got to be something to it, right? It felt like really good quality right when I took it out of the box (but let's be real...who needs such good quality when it comes to a water bottle...?) with a really nice handle and cover. I filled it with ice water in the kitchen and took it up to my room, both fully air conditioned. By the time I remembered to drink from it, the ice had already melted. I tried again in case that was a fluke, but nope. Not even an hour, and there was no more ice left. The water stayed moderately cold, but there was really nothing to it. My plastic Poland Spring bottle left sitting out from yesterday was the same temperature.
I returned the Stanley on the grounds that the product was defective - I mean, everyone raves about it, so maybe it was only mine that didn't stay ice? I ordered another one to give Stanley a second shot and we'll see what happens.
Other than the ice, it was a pretty ok cup. The weight didn't bother me, it fit in my car cup holder, the color was pretty. Can't say anything about leaks because I didn't turn the cup upside down, but maybe I'll try with my new one.",1
"The design and build quality seem great except the swivel bar on top leaks - on initial and subsequent use. Water leaks on top of the cup while walking or tilting the cup to drink Safety Note: It then seeps back into the water reservoir if tilted toward the top swivel bar (eww contamination).

So far, the Stanley support form hasn't resulted in a response. There should possibly be an O ring or tight fitting plastic that is water tight.

Will probably return to Amazon if no response soon. Maybe, I just got one with a defective top.

Edit: Response from Stanley Support: ""Please be advised that Quenchers are designed as non-leak-proof tumblers.

If you have other concerns, please do not hesitate to ask.""

Definitely returning item since they won't even acknowledge a problem or offer to send a replacement top.",1
"I bought this cup because of the hype and the color. I was so excited. I washed it, filled the cup to the brim with ice and then filled it with water. I wanted to see how long I would have ice for. I came back 2.5-3 hours later and all the ice had literally melted. There was not a piece of ice left. Just a cup of room temp water. I thought maybe I didn’t close the lid enough so I tried again. 2.5 hour later and again no ice. I have another tumbler by a big name brand and spent about 20 dollars more and I had ice in that for 48 hours. I’m not sure if I got a defective cup or what but I’m not impressed by the Stanley.",1
"I bought one of these tumblers and they are all hype, I am honestly disappointed that I bought this tumbler. Ice does not last any longer in this tumbler than it did in any of the tumblers I have owned before. I assumed because of all the hype that ice would last for 2 days like it says but that is not true because I put ice in the tumbler at night and by the next day there is nothing but water in the tumbler. I stupidly bought this cup because of the fire video and now I 100% know that video was BS.",1
"Newsflash: After all the hype surrounding this insulated tumbler, I finally decided to purchase one. Unfortunately, after two days, I happened upon an article on Google about these tumblers when I noticed one particular word that caught my attention in the title...Lead! I read the article in which the company admitted to using lead as part of the sealing agent that helps seal and insulate the tumbler. I was instantly mortified at what I just read and informed my mother about the article because she had purchase one right after me. I was shocked that Stanley would keep this a secret for so long after selling what I would think possibly several thousand of these insulated tumblers. Staying healthy is hard enough without a company feeding me a product with lead in it! The nerve and dare I say audacity of this company after so many incidents involving lead in this country affecting children especially. Needless to say I will be returning this item post haste and will not be purchasing another Stanley product anytime soon or maybe even ever!",2
"I had no idea of the hype that surrounded these when I bought 2 of them, shows how much I keep up to date with such things! I just wanted large capacity water bottles with a handle.

These things are solid enough. But the fact they are so hard to open makes them utterly frustrating to use.
If you have any hand/wrist dexterity issues, carpal tunnel or something, then good luck. I don’t, but every time I need to open the bottle it’s a drama. No grip on the edges of the lid is part of the problem, as is the fact it’s such a short lid, so there’s not much to get hold of. Then the suction just adds to it. Just a very poorly designed cup.

Not worth the hype, or cost, at all.",2
"The cup itself is very pretty but I have a problem with how it came. The cup came with multiple scratches and the color looks fated, the straw somehow also got scratched, the bottom of the cup is also very damaged and I don’t see I reason why it should be like that. The package was also horrible they didn’t even wrap it properly. I had previously ordered 2 other Stanley’s which in fact also came in damaged one came with dents and scratches and the other one just scratches. I just find it unreasonable to pay so much for a cup and it coming in looking like it’s used.",2
"There is so much to like about this cup but one issue makes it hard for me to love it. Specifically, the lid is problematic. If I screw it on so that the hole/straw is 90 degrees away from the handle then it is so tight that I cannot unscrew it when I need to refill it. If I remember to not go so tight then the straw/hole is not in the correct position to naturally take a drink and you have to hold it at an awkward angle.",2
"I’m not sure if this Stanley cup is defective but I bought mine from a dicks sporting goods and it keeps my ice cold for at least 16 hours even after I keep refilling it with regular room temperature water. I decided to buy one for my partner on Amazon but for some reason his ice is completely gone within 5 hours maybe 6 at the most. He was completely disappointed, he finally just ends up taking his cheap Walmart tumbler to work. Not sure if it’s defected or what :/",2
"I got 2 for each kid and I assumed they were leak proof. Nope they aren't for the money I definitely thought they would be. Others that have straws and are cheaper are leak proof. My kids love them and Santa brought them soooo I didn't return them. I just don't like that I gotta buy another attachment to make them spill proof from the straw hole. The straw cover i already figured I'd have to get those. But the hole.. bad design!",2
"The base cap of a product comes off and exposes the seal. So we had to send the cup back for a refund, I wanted the cup replaced ASAP but the expected exchanged item would've taken over 30 days to deliver. So I had to order another Stanley cup from Dick's Sporting Goods. My wife was only able to use the Stanley Cup for 2hrs, she took it out of the box and cleaned the cup and boom now I'm here writing this review.",2
"I ordered one of the cream Stanley’s front uis exact website or company, and it was perfect! Loved the cream color and everything! But I ordered another one same color, cream, and it just arrived and it is a light pink cup with a cream handle! It’s so weird and I do not like it but I don’t want to go through all of the trouble of returning it so I guess I’m just stuck with a defective Stanley😭🙄",2
"Cup was bought for retail price from Amazon and not a third party so you know it’s the real deal. However the coating had a bubble on the finish. No bigger than and eighth of an inch. However if I’m paying retail price for a Stanley, I expect it to be flawless. And if later on it gets scratched than that’s on me. Good thing is Amazon is sending a replacement with no charge on the pretext that I send the other one back within 30 days- no problem. I gave it only 2 stars because I’m hoping the new one that’s being sent to me doesn’t have any blemishes.",2
"This is the second Stanley cup I have. The first cup’s handle came off. I called Stanley and they sent me a new cup to replace it. A few weeks after the second cup’s handle also came off without any apparent reason. I think it is too of a coincidence of both handles coming off!
I think these cups are overrated and any double-wall vacuum insulated cup will perform the same job.",2
"I get it. Everyone is buying these now after years of not caring about Stanley tumblers because of social media. The problem with viral crap like this is we get caught up in fitting in and jumping on the band wagon that we fail to see what's wrong with a product before buying it.
THIS TUMBLER IS NOT LEAK PROOF. It's not even a little resistent to leaking. Even if you have the top fully closed and the straw taken out, the liquid inside will leak out like crazy if you tip it over even slightly. To me, if I'm going to carry around 30-40oz of hot or cold liquids then the tumbler MUST prevent said liquids from coming out. I understand it's not a water bottle, but that's a lame technicality that Stanley shouldn't cling to. At a MINIMUM the tumbler should be leak proof if I take out the straw and close the top. Furthermore, the sip top closing mechanism seems very flimsy and can be easily bended out of place, so beware of turning it too hard or especially dropping your tumbler.
I am highly disappointed for being sucked into thinking this was a reliable tumbler that would replace others I have. Granted they are not as nice looking, but they do the job of holding AND containing the water I take with me all day to and from work in NYC.
I do NOT recommend this tumbler and I would suggest that Stanley fix these important issues instead of focusing on more colors and patterns.",3
"The tumbler is great, I got the 30oz and the 40oz, clearly the 30oz is the right size for me and I just love sipping from it all day.

However I do not understand why Stanley keeps sending its precious tumblers without any protective wrapping, mine arrived with the paint chipped (I see the bare metal underneath on half a centimeter) and this is both stupid and unacceptable.

As usual, Amazon has handled this perfectly but seriously Stanley, I am sure the price of your tumblers leave some room for a stupid plastic wrap around them!!",3
"I will be honest; this cup is just like any other cup. It's like an Owala or a Yeti cup. The downside of it is it is so heavy to carry. (if you have metacarpal problems, then I would say no to it for the 40oz) It does keep water cool, but so does the Yeti and Owala. If you want to get the Stanley because it's cute, then, by all means, go ahead, but if you want a cup to keep drinks cool and you want to save some money, then get an alternative.",3
"My daughter insisted we jump on the Stanley wagon even though we have plenty of the other two big brands. I bought 3 for valentine gifts. The straw seal and mouth piece closure leak easily. We had to purchase separate inside reinforcement seals for the straw and sip slot and straw caps to cover up the exposed straw. I also purchased boots to cut down on the bottom wear and tear. I like the overall model of it, but it's way heavier than my other high end 40oz. Overrated!",3
"I bought this for my daughter she has been wanting a Stanley so I bought one for her and once you drop it it will immediately have a dent on it and not all cups have dents on them immediately once you drop it second the cup will leak from where your supposed to put the straw in I wouldn’t waste my money on this cup when you can buy a cheaper one and a non leaking and one that won’t have a dent when your drop it immediately",3
"Honestly was super hopeful about this cup. It’s my first Stanley and I won’t be buying another. I was excited to have a big cup that I didn’t have to use a straw because cleaning those is just not something I enjoy. It is just not a good drinking experience without a straw. The handle is very comfortable and I prefer it to the Yetti handle but there is a weird like lip that holds the liquid and it’s then warm when you go to take the next sip. Maybe not a problem for everyone but it drives me nuts as I like my drinks very cold. Also the part on lid that spins to let you drink without the straw or close the lid is definitely not a tight seal so even when it looks like it is closed it definitely spills liquid and not like a small amount either. In my opinion it’s definitely not worth the money and the Simple Modern ones are much nicer even though you have to use a straw.",3
"I have bought the 40oz version, and although it is true, it is comfortable to carry with you, it does not keep the drinks ice cold for the time indicated, the ice defrosts in minutes and the frozen drink remains for a few hours and not the 11 hours indicated, the anti-drip system has its deficiencies, it is not completely airtight, but well it half fulfills, I don't know if there are better ones, I will continue trying with other manufacturers, I think it is an over-advertised product.",3
"Would give 5 stars, because I love the look of this cup, but if you are looking for a cup that keeps ice for more than 12 hours, this is not the cup. I drink 40 oz’s of water within my 8 hour work day so this cup works perfectly. However, after 12 hours the ice is completely melted. Also if the cup tips slightly it leaks. If it tips over even for a second, most of the liquid spills out.",3
"I bought the 64 oz Stanley and loved it! I drink a lot of water. My meds cause dry mouth. Then after a week or two I had terrible shoulder pain. I was confused until I realized lifting the water bottle full is causing injury! I've stopped using it until the soreness goes away. Then I guess I can use it when I start lifting weights. I feel like a warning is appropriate.",3
"I was excited when I ordered this cup. I loved the color. I had a Stanley cup before this one but I left my lid somewhere so I decided to just get a completely new one and different color. The shipping was quick. I did notice when I opened it that it didn't feel like my other Stanley cup. Also noting that I paid about $35 less than the other cup. I did wonder if it was a true Stanley cup. I've only had it a little over a month and the things I've noticed most are that the ice doesn't last as long, my handle became loose quickly, and the middle piece in the middle of the lid was different (which wasn't really an issue).
I decided to leave a review because my loose handle actually broke. Now I'm stuck with a cup that I can't return because it's barely outside the return window. I feel like a real Stanley cup wouldn't have this issue. Or at least I didn't have any issues with my other one. I lost the lid and that was my fault and my only issue. Suppose I should have just bought a new lid for it instead.
Beware of the handle on this cup.",3
"I did not want to buy a Stanley Cup because of the hype. Once I read reviews and on how long it keeps water, cool, I decided to buy one for me and my husband. He has the black one and I have the one in fog in the picture, these tumblers do keep your water cold for long periods of time. I still had ice in mine from the night before, which is impressive. They are a bit heavier, but I don’t mind that I’ve already dropped it, and it left a little bit of a scratch, but no dents. Overall a great quality Tumblr. The only issue I have is that it is not leak proof . My Hydro flask tumblers are leak proof, but they don’t keep things as cool as the Stanley cups. I also got the 40 ounce ones for both of us, I drink a lot of water, and this helps me stay hydrated.",4
"I use my Stanley cup to keep cold drinks cold and it does that very well. I’ve filled it with ice in the morning and still have ice at the end of the day. I love that it has a straw rather than me drinking from a lid (less likely for me to spill on myself. However, that means it’s not spill proof. I’m okay with that as I would not expect it to be. The reason I deducted a star was that the handle sits a little too low, so I can’t secure it well in my car cup holder or the side pocket of my backpack. Since it doesn’t go in very far, it’s very top heavy and not well balanced, causing it to want to fall over/out. So, just think about how you want to carry your cup around to determine if you want one with a handle or not.",4
"I purchased 40 oz pool and 40 oz pink dusk

There are a lot of reviews in regards to it being real or fake. I took detailed pictures of everything on the blue one and included the confirmation number from amazon in an email to stanley. The dude that responded said it was authentic.

The blue one did not come packed well and does have a scratch (picture included). The pink one was packaged well and is flawless.

Shipping took forever but it came earlier then expected.

I took 1 star off for the scratch.

If you are looking for a stanley these ones are at retail price. All of the pool blue and pink dusks I have found for sell are online, used, scratched and marked up to $90 and are unavailable on stanleys website.

So I am happy with my purchase and feel confident they are authentic.

Why does it matter if its authentic? Because if it is a knock off you don't know what material is used to make it and you are paying full price!

Also there is a lot of buzz going around about the lead in stanley cups. Its sealed with lead, so there is no lead on the outside or where your drink goes. Its only on the inside of the cup and will only be exposed if the button (circle piece on bottom) falls out. With that being said I only hand wash incase it were to fall out. If it falls out in the washing machine then your whole machine would be contaminated.",4
"I purchased my grandson a Yeti mug and he insisted on a Stanly (that's not a knock on the Yeti brand, he wanted just a larger cup with a bigger handle)

I told him he had to get one himself and he tried to get this model on TMEU. Within 3 days the logo wore off and the TMEU brand and the lid broke, so I got him this and he loves it!

He likes it because he can hold it with gloves on and he dropped it a few times and did no real damage (small dent, that's it). It holds water ice cold, and the ice lasts a very long time, ... good brand and build IMO",4
"So, the cup is perfect and is exactly what I wanted. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about the cup itself. This is my 3rd Stanley, and I absolutely love them! That being said, there was nothing in the box to protect the cup. It was in a larger box with just the cup, no packaging paper, bubble wrap, nothing to protect it. I’ve been searching for this color of Stanley for months, finally found it for more money than it would’ve been originally, took the plunge, and it was shipped with absolutely nothing to protect it from getting damaged. I was very very lucky that mine didn’t arrive damaged, but just letting others know that it’s a gamble if you purchase. I would’ve given 5 stars had the tumbler actually had some type of protection when being shipped, but knocking off a star for bad packaging.",4
"Ok so first off let me say I’m not a super picky guy BUT……….when I spend $60 on a cup I kinda want this thing in new condition
When my Stanley 64 oz’er came I was stoked UNTIL I opened the box there was literally no packaging just a cup thrown in a box and the instructions inside the cup
In addition the said $60 cup has a DEEP gouge on the side I was pretty jazzed ta receive this cup as I have a ton but this is my first Stanley and at this point my last
Absolutely unacceptable for the price we pay for these cups
Ok so quick update I called Amazon and they had a new cup in the mail and at my step within about 3 days so I upped my one star to a four that being said the cup is awesome holds ice did days LITERALLY my only complaint is the lid does indeed leak like crazy but I guess that’s the price ya pay ta be cool and trendy all and all I think it’s a super cool and useful cup and the good outweighs the bad",4
"What I like the most are two things: The handle, and the wide straw. It really is more ""quenching"" because you get more water in a sip. I also love the handle. I'm coming from a 22 oz Yeti with no handle and no straw. My only complaint / suggestion would be to add a rubber cushion to the bottom. A lot of people use these at night and they don't want to wake their partner when they put the thing down after taking a drink. I bought some 2.2"" rubber ""tumbler bottoms"" on Amazon and added two to the bottom of my Stanley Cup. One on top of the other. I also bought the rubber sleeve they sell, but it comes off when removing it from my car cupholder, so I just take it off before getting in the car, and put it back on around the house. Or not. The rubber tumble bottoms work well.",4
"I wanted soooo bad this Stanley Quencher that when I had the opportunity to buy it I did it. However, it's not a quencher you can take with you everywhere because of the weight, size and also because it's not leak proof (because of the straw of course, I know, and for the bottle cap). I absolutely loved the color I choose and the material is made of great quiality, I don't doubt it. It also keeps the beverages cold for some hours.
But if I had to choose it again, I simply wouldn't buy it and I rather buy a Stanley cup with leak proof. I'm the kind of person who likes to take her water bottle everywhere and I simply can't with this one, because of everything I just said. So if you want this quencher, think it about it twice! In any case, it's a great product and great brand.",4
"I like it besides the fact that it spills through the straw area very easily. I think some people overhyped how long it stays cold, mine usually retains ice for a couple hours not “a couple of days” the color was very pretty and the handle is nice for carrying the cup. Overall, I think Stanley cups are really just the “new hydro flask” and it’s not really worth as much as it costs for it just being a generic tumbler (especially how easily it spills)",4
"I have one other stanley cup that I had received as a gift for my birthday and decided to buy another for work. While I know that they keep drinks cool for quite sometime, I always drink my beverage before the 4 hr mark. I decided to test how long it will keep ice water iced and thus far it has been over 24 hrs that the ice has remained in my warm office where I left it over night. I'm very glad that I purchased this. The cup is so beautiful and the biggest reason for my purchase was the Deco design. The only complaint that I have about Stanley cups is that they are not as spill/leak resistant as some other cup brands I've bought. There will mainly be some spillage from the hole in the center of the lid where the straw holder inserts into the lid.
Overall, I do recommend the purchase of the Deco Stanley collection if you drink a lot of liquid like myself and want something a bit more stylish than a plain cup.",4
"I think this is a great option for staying hydrated throughout the day if you work long hours at a desk and don't want to get up frequently to refill your cup with water or ice. It does keep the ice cold for a long time, as long as you put a lot of cubes in there to start with. I usually toss at least 8 or 9 cubes in, or around 1/3 of the cup.

It is quite large and unweildy and leaks quite easily, so personally I wouldn't really carry it around anywhere outside the house, except for car errands. If you are driving and running errands, it fits well in a cup holder.

The straw is easy to sip from, and so it can be quite soothing to sip some ice cold water while working and focusing on something.

The bottom of the cup is kind of loud when you put it on the table, so I got a silicone boot/coaster for it, and to protect that lead pellet from any sort of damage! lol If you have a wobbily surface, it will tip over and start leaking! It's a little top heavy by design.

I've found it pretty easy to clean. It hasn't gotten dirty very easily. I only use it for water.

While the product doesn't really blow my mind, it is aesthetically pleasing and gets the job done. It's a little pick me up or a shiny object to look at on your desk while you are working. It does come in handy for long work days.",5

"I love this cup. It keeps my water super cold all the time. It keeps my ice frozen. Its good quality and is super durable. This is my first Stanley cup and I have no complaints. Well other than it spills once you tip it over, but that will happen because of the straw. It's not because its defective. I got the 40oz cup. In the light purple, and it is super cute. Overall, its defiantly worth the money.",5
"As a parent striving to keep my daughter hydrated, finding a suitable water tumbler became a priority, especially since she asked for one for her birthday. Enter the Stanley Quencher H2.0 FlowState Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Tumbler. Let me tell you, it has exceeded my expectations.
First, my daughter loves this tumbler. She's become quite attached to it, and if she's drinking a couple of these 40-oz tumblers each day while at school, I know she's staying hydrated, which brings me a deep sense of reassurance as a parent.
The standout feature of the Stanley Quencher is its ability to keep water cold for an impressively long time. Even on scorching hot days, the water inside remains refreshingly cold, ensuring that my daughter stays hydrated throughout the day.
From a practical standpoint, the tumbler is also well-designed. The lid and straw make it easy for my daughter to drink from, and the construction feels incredibly durable and built to last. Plus, the vacuum insulation means no condensation on the outside, preventing any messes or slippery hands.
The Stanley Quencher H2.0 FlowState Tumbler has become an essential part of my daughter's daily routine. Its ability to keep water cold and its practical design make it a winner in my book.",5
"My daughter was adamant on buying it and I was not. She used her own money, that she earned by putting up lemonade stall last summer. The tumbler arrived in 4 days. As much as I hate to admit, I was pleasantly surprised. Looks beautiful, very sturdy. Comes in these pretty, very soothing colors, completely leakproof. The water stays cool for a very long periods of time. The ice does not melt even in overnight. Very happy with the purchase. A bit pricey for my taste, but totally worth it.",5
"I had no idea that the Stanley Tumbler was a ""a thing"" when I purchased my aluminum model for myself and a blue model for my partner. All I knew was that I needed a convenient way to keep track of my water intake after my doctor told me that I was not drinking enough water. I already had other name brand tumblers that I've purchased in the past, mostly for coffee and soft drinks, but none of them satisfied all of my requirements including ease of cleaning, secure permanently attached handle, and cupholder compatibility. Each one was great in one area, but none of them were great in all areas. The 30 oz Stanley Quencher H2.0 FlowState was a perfect fit for my needs and has proven to be the one tumbler that I use every single day.

The fact that the Stanley Quencher H2.0 FlowState tumbler can leak through the straw/sip hole if tipped did not come as a surprise. It's a consequence of the design and readily apparent simply by looking at the tumbler's design. I do not throw my Stanley Quencher H2.0 FlowState in a backpack or leave it tipped over on a car seat or on furniture. The convenience of having the straw readily available at all times and the fact that the Stanley Quencher H2.0 FlowState tumbler rests securely in the cup holders of both of my vehicles far outweighs any concerns I have about leakage. Fast food and coffee boutique cups are far more prone to tipping and leaking than is my Stanley tumbler.

I'm glad that I picked the 30 oz size. It's a good compromise between capacity and convenience of use and handling. I think the 40 oz would have been difficult to contend with, especially if you are holding the tumbler with only one hand. My previous tumblers were in the 20 oz range without handles which was a bit too small. Even with a smaller 20 oz capacity, the versions of the same tumbler with handles seemed rather flimsy compared to the Stanley Quencher H2.0 FlowState. I upgraded to a 30 oz version of my other brand tumbler, but the handle was detachable and never felt totally secure, especially when trying to use it with a cupholder.

Again, the Stanley Quencher H2.0 FlowState tumbler hit the mark on all of my requirements. But I never imagined that I'd now be part of a pop cult and tumbler meme. Pretty crazy.",5
"So, I recently hopped on the ""Stanley Quencher H2.0 FlowState"" bandwagon, and let me tell you, it's not just a tumbler; it's a membership to the elite ""I-own-a-cup-that-survived-a-blazing-inferno"" club! Here's my hilarious journey with this amazing, fireproof(?) vessel:

Fire and Ice Magic: ★★★★★
I bought several of these cups as holiday gifts after witnessing a video where someone's car was on fire, and it came out still chillin' like it just took a ice bath. Now, if I ever find myself in a car fire, at least I know my drink will stay refreshingly cold. Who knew a tumbler could moonlight as a superhero in a car-b-que scenario?

Size Matters, But in a Good Way: ★★★★★
Yes, the cup is huge. It's the Arnold Schwarzenegger of tumblers. But, hey, we're not just sipping beverages; we're making a statement! I feel like a beverage royalty member, and I'm half expecting a tiny butler to pop out of the lid with a monocle.

Amazon Wins, Target Brawls Lose: ★★★★★
I refuse to stand in line at Target and risk a showdown for these cups. My quest for hydration greatness should not come with a side of potential fisticuffs. Thank you, Amazon, for sparing me the unnecessary drama and allowing me to buy these cups peacefully from the comfort of my couch.

Elite Club Vibes: ★★★★★
Yes, I feel like part of an exclusive club, a secret society of cup enthusiasts who appreciate the finer things in life—like not having to worry about our ice melting too soon. It's like being in a covert operation, only with more hydration and fewer spy gadgets.

Cost Be Damned: ★★★★★
Despite the price tag, I would buy this cup over and over again. It's not just a cup; it's a lifestyle. A Stanley Quencher lifestyle where my drinks stay colder than my ex's heart. Totally worth every penny, and I might even consider taking out a second mortgage for extra cups! LOL

Hydration Win: ★★★★★
Bonus points for unintentionally encouraging me to drink more water! It's like my daily water intake has doubled, thanks to the irresistible allure of this magical tumbler. I'm practically a health guru now, all because of a cup.

In conclusion, the Stanley Quencher H2.0 FlowState Tumbler is not just a cup; it's a comical, oversized, fire-resistant marvel that brings joy, hydration, and the dream of tiny butlers to our lives. Five stars for making me feel like a hydration superhero and for avoiding potential Target brawls. 🚗🔥❄️✨",5
"I opted on buying the 14oz Stanley Cup due to being a Momma on a major budget. My daughter begged me for weeks to buy her one of these because some of her friends from class had one. I struggled with rationalizing purchasing something at this price point because I'm a single mother and I honestly I just cannot afford to buy things like this.... BUT when I saw there was a $20 option and that it would be the perfect size for my daughter to take to school each day, I surprised her and bought it. I can say with complete certainty that I am thrilled with the purchase! It keeps her water cold all day and is very well made!!! After purchasing lots and lots of the cheaper plastic water bottles over the years, that most always leak and/or break, I'm very happy with this cup due to the durability as well at the temperature it keeps the liquids inside of it. This turned out to be a great little investment bc it seems as though she can use it for many school years to come! No more leaky cups for my little munchkin!!!! I absolutely recommend purchasing to anyone debating on spending the money on any of the size options and colors!

We got the yellow cup (it's beautiful) and my daughter was thrilled (and very grateful) to take her new tumbler to school!!!",5
"I bought this less than 2 months ago and love the ability to sip or chug from the same bottle. It also comes in some good color combos. This bottle was only used with water so I can’t speak to any other uses and was used in the winter so I can’t speak to ice retention. Since it stinks so bad I won’t be able to truly test its durability.

One time near a campfire is all it took to turn it into garbage, and one chat with customer service sealed my decision to never buy another product from Owala. So what happened? The bottle was used once near a camp fire and the lid smelled so strongly of smoke that it was hard to drink from. The cleaning regime started with a standard wash with soap and hot water, then do the same with vinegar, then so the same with baking soda, then soak in various combos, etc… each time it changed the smell, never getting rid of the old smell. I reached out to customer service which was about as crappy as you could imagine, no offered solutions, no understanding, no silicone part replacement, no reading of the emails, just canned responses that don’t correlate to the email that was sent.

The thing to keep in mind is that smell is particulate. This means that when you smell something it is particles of that thing going into your nostrils which in this case means that the silicone seal on the lid of the bottle holds onto enough particles that can’t e washed off to retain a strong odor. This can’t be sanitary!

You can’t buy replacement silicone pieces and they haven’t redesigned so stay away!!",1
"UPDATE 2months after purchase. Owala refused to replace, warranty repair the lid on a bottle that was 1.5 months old when warranty process started. they rejected it because they said "" excludes damage caused by normal wear-and-tear"". Keep in mind bottle was used for 2 weeks when the problem stated below started.

This is initial review......I bought 2 of these. about 2 weeks after i bought my first bottle the lid would no longer pop up. contacted owala and submitted the following per their warranty claim procedure: 1) give them all your personal information 2) write a description of the issue 3) tell them the color of the bottle 4) send a picture of the bottle 5) send a picture of the bottom of the bottle 7) send a VIDEO of the problem. Then they emailed me a few days later asking me to send them another video of the lid NOT opening. 8) sent yet another video of the bottle not opening......At this time i still dont have a functioning bottle.",1
"Review for: Owala FreeSip Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle with Straw
First of all, I was a diehard Stanley user...and then the truth about them came out. They manufacture their bottles with lead! Why? I don't know and I don't care! My needs are having ice last for the entire day, I don't care if it can or cannot go in the dishwasher. I hand wash these bottles.
My new bottle is NOT keeping cold! The ice is melting throughout the day! This is not my experience with my first Owala. I should return and exchange but it upsets me to have to do this for a brand new bottle. Very inconvenient! I may need to start searching for a different brand.",1
"I really wanted to like this one because it is so cute, but it has awful detergent smell after countless of wash. I reached out customer service and they gave me tips to wash it with vinegar and charcoal. I tried it and it got little better but still has that weird smell. I reached out again and they said they can not help me anymore.
I used all kind of water bottles from different brands and this is the only one has smell even if I tried various method.

So disappointed from this brand and poor customer service.",1
"I bought this for my daughter’s 5th birthday because I have 2 owala bottles and she wanted one. I washed it out and went to hand it to her and it has a huge dent in the bottom. I wouldn’t have minded if I purchased it at a discount price as a “used” item but I paid full price. I will be sending it back for a replacement as I think someone dropped it and returned it. Other than that I actually love owala free sip bottles. I keep boots on mine to avoid damage like this.",1
"I loved this water bottle in the beginning because how convenient it was to use. But after it fell a couple ft from the counter, the lid has come apart and is not able to be put back together no matter how hard I try. I could just buy a replacement lid, but it doesn’t seem worth the money given the quality of this product.",1
"My wife purchased this bottle for me because she has one and loves it. On hers, when you hit the button, the lid opens immediately. On my new bottle, you hit the button and sometimes the lid takes 2-3 seconds to open. I sent a video to customer service and they said this was normal operation. How can you say this when we have 2 bottles and they are different quality. The fact that they can't even send a new lid is poor customer service.",1
"I switched from our trusty Takeyas for my kids because drinking from the Owala straw seemed fun. I am super disappointed with the Owala because the button popped off of it and won't go back on. It's just junk now, but because I bought it on Amazon, I can't return it since it's been more than a month. What a bummer.",1
"Love these bottles but the ones I received from Amazon have some quality issues. First one was clearly used and arrived with water inside. I received a replacement in a sealed bag (good sign). It worked great for a couple of days then the button popped off, I put it back on but it keeps coming off, hitting me in the face. Not sure what to do with it now. The bottles are great, just not the ones from here.",1
"The parts of the lid that pop up snapped off today after using it for about a month. I was fully closing it and popping it back open for every use and maybe it’s not made to withstand that but I want a bottle that will fully close when I’m not drinking from it and I thought this would be that.",1
"Update: It's been a month since I made this review and a few days after that the lid stopped opening on it's own. Now I have to press the button and push it open which kinda sucks since the pop open lid was a nice feature. Gave it 2 stars now :(

I really like the design of having a lid and multi-use lock/handle! I also like that it's flat on the sides which makes it easier to hold imo. The water stays cold for about a day but if you live somewhere hot (like Arizona) it won't stay cold that long unless you add ice. Also, the lid on mine gets stuck and takes a few seconds to pop open. It was instant when I first got it, but now I have to wait for it to open which is inconvenient. Lastly, *before* the lid got stuck sometimes when I press the button to open it water would come out and splash me in the face. Idk how else to explain it but it was weird. Anyways, that's why I gave it 3 stars.",2
"From the very first use, the release button kept popping off, often flying across the room. I contacted the company. They made me submit extensive evidence about the issue, requiring multiple emails over several days. I thought they would send a new cap, or maybe a replacement button. At the end, they sent me a $13 credit for their store. But the kicker is that all replacement items in the store, including caps, are out of stock and have remained out of stock. I would have been better off returning it instead. By the time I figured that out, I no longer had the shipping materials. So I ended up keeping it. Some electrical tape over the button has kept it from popping off. But the experience was disappointing.",2
"I like this bottle of great deal. But the button that disengages the top will break because it's not properly set in. When this happens the button will shoot across the room because there is a spring locking mechanism behind it. I thought I was the only one who had this problem, but I searched the lower star reviews and it seems that other people have the same experience. I will keep the bottle but the company really needs to find a new style of button that's more secure. I'm so worried about losing that button and not being able to close the top of this thing.",2
"I bought one of these bottles for myself, and loved it so much that I got two more for my daughters. The bottle is easy to drink from, easy to clean, very sturdy, keeps water cold forever (even in summer in central Texas!).

HOWEVER. One of the Owala bottles I bought for the kiddos would not close properly. The rubber gasket prevented it from closing. I tried a gasket from one of the bottles that COULD close, and that fixed the problem, so yes. Clearly the gasket. I contacted Owala to see if I could get a replacement gasket. They began by telling me that it must be my fault. I must have dropped the bottle, and their warranty does not cover damage by the user. I re-explained that it was clearly the gasket, and they sent me a list of trouble-shooting tips, all of which I had already tried. I RE-explained about the gasket, and they finally said that they do not offer replacement gaskets, and that as my bottle is an ""Amazon exclusive"", they could not offer a replacement lid. They sent me a free shipping code, in case I would like to purchase a replacement bottle. No thank you.

Long story short (I know, too late), if you get a good bottle, you win! Awesome bottle! Yay you! If you do NOT get a good bottle, I would not count on the company to stand behind their warranty.",2
"First, the push button/latch that locks the lid cap sticks, so much so that i need to use a solid utensil to force the latch to disengage. That defeats the purpose of using it as a travel water vessel. Second, the vessel doesn't fit in the console cup holders or the door cup holders in either our small SUV or our large SUV. Also, it is too large for a comfortable grip with my medium sized women's hands. I may return & replace to see if the defective latch mechanism is specific to this item only. Would not recommend.",2
"I’m very disappointed, this is my second owala bottle. I loved my first one so much that I got a second one. This one does not keep my water cold at all. I even did a side by side test with my old one. I put the same amount of ice cubes in each one and came back 5 hours later and tested both. The old one still ice cold and the new one was warm. I may have gotten a bad one so I’m going to reach out and see if I can get it replaced",2
"I love this water bottle. The design of the straw part is great. However, the latch is a piece of cheap plastic that broke off after about 10 uses and so now I can’t close the top of the water bottle. Customer service told me that I need to fill out a warranty request form and they will determine whether or not this is workmanship. This is not good service and therefore a water bottle that I originally would have rated a five is now a two.",2
"My son loves his, so I got one also after I lost my old water bottle. I bought it for a trip, but never got to put any water in it, as when it fell out of my backpack while checking my bag and fell less than 3 ft to the floor, the lid and hinge popped off. Try as I might I could not get hinge back in, and even if I had I'm sure the spring would have not been in properly. Without the complex lid it's useless as it cannot be sealed. After 15min I gave up and threw it out rather carry my whole trip. An NFL bottle at the airport (all I could find) only cost a few $ and is more reliable.",2
"I love this water bottle so much but even with normal use and care, the spring on the lid broke within the first month or two. Now the lid won’t close and so for me, it is unusable. I wanted to love this bottle and was initially planning to buy more because i loved it so much, but now I just don’t think it’s worth it.",2
"I ordered the 24oz (smallest size), in ‘Grayt’ coloring.

Seems like a well built bottle with a smooth opening lid and I love the color as well.

This bottle does not fit in any of my vehicles cup holders which is unfortunate. Tried 2 different vehicles.

Next issue is it slides all around on smooth surfaces since the bottom finish is also very smooth. It could use some rubber on the bottom to help keep it in place or from falling over. (Yes I know I can buy the rubber boot for an extra $7)

The straw feature isn’t needed but is a nice feature anyway, and I like that the bottle doesn’t stand too tall.",2
"first off, i am quite fond of the spout design. i really appreciate the dual drinking options and the removable silicone seal that makes cleaning easy. the carry/lock loop is convenient, but i can see the plastic detents that lock them down wearing over time. i've read a review where the plastic lid is fragile if dropped, so i've been wary to prevent it from dropping. the selection of colorways are unique. unfortunately, that's where the pro's end. the label claims ""24 hours cold"" - in my experience it should be revised to ""2 hours cold"". on my second outing with this bottle i left on a bookshelf only to find it sitting in a puddle of condensation only after a couple of hours. when i filled the container with ice and liquid, after 30 minutes, moisture started forming on the exterior. sadly, my y**i 20oz rambler retains ice longer, but it lack the portable and useful features of this one. lastly, i was disappointed in amazon's choice to ship my initial order in a plain brown paper bag. owala markets this item with only a printed label band around the waist of the bottle, so you can imagine how it faired the abuse of shipping during transit . it arrived with several dents on the exterior, with one creasing the metal. i ordered a replacement, but amazon again shipped it in the same paper bag. again, it arrived with surface imperfections, but i decided to keep it, knowing the third time it'd ship similarly. i understand both parties are trying to be wiser about paper waste, but there needs to be more logical ways to get to product to customers without damage.",3
"I really like this water bottle. The size and function for the gym is great! Like others I'm disappointed with the lid closure. I have to be very careful and make sure the clip does not pop all the way off (it has a few times and I've just popped it back on). I'm afraid that eventually it's going to pop off and get lost or the plastic will eventually wear or break keeping it from closing. It was super pricey for such a flaw.

If it weren't for the lid, I'd give it a 5 star. Otherwise it's everything I wanted from a water bottle.",3
"I wanted to love this water bottle so bad, I love the look, the sip and chug - obsessed. But I am one of those people that likes to drink their water ice cold and whelp this is where the disappointment comes into play. Before buying I checked to make sure it would keep ice for at least 24 hours and it said it would but as I have come to find out that was not true, so now I am just a girl holding a cool looking water bottle with kinda cold water wishing I had some ice.",3
"We are a WATER BOTTLE FAMILY. We drink out of water bottles daily as we are both away at work/school. We both went through at least 4 BRITAS and 2 Phillips water bottles in 2023. They weren’t holding up, so I decided to try OWALA.

I don’t like to give stars off of a product for something that could’ve been Amazon / the carriers fault. But I ordered this on December 5th, didn’t get it until January 6th, and it came in with 3 small dents. I’m sure with a sleeve it won’t be noticeable but still unfortunate.
SMALL HANDS. The bottle itself is hard to grip, and without the indention on the side, my small hands definitely wouldn’t be able to hold the bottle without dropping it. Hopefully the handle at the top comes in handy!
The straw inside is also made out of a thicker material than most. The mouth part, which is a hard plastic, isn’t too hard to where I feel like I’ll chip a tooth. But it isn’t a super soft rubbery material like a lot of water bottles are.
If any issues / problems occur with use, I’ll edit the review, but for now I am only unhappy with the cosmetic issue that flawed the aesthetics of the bottle.",3
"It never fails that whenever I use this bottle, the straw falls out of its place in the cap. For the amount of money this costs, I would have hoped for a more reliable way to get a cool drink of water when I need it. In addition, I had to buy a special insert for my car cup holder to accommodate this. I wouldn’t recommend buying it.",3
"Bought this for myself for Christmas, so the first time I used it was outside return window. The push button broke within one hour of first use. I went through a whole warranty process. For a $30 waterbottle. It took nearly two weeks to learn that they will only credit a new lid - in black. What a disappointing purchase.",3
"I am not a fan of the Stanley but love my 46oz Coldest but because it is very heavy, I wanted something smaller. The only problem with the 40oz is that it does not fit the standard cup holder. I'm thinking of getting the 32 oz too and a different color. It hard to get stain off my white Owala bottle.",3
"I’ve had Hydroflasks before, but wanted to give Owala a try. I like the sleek design, and the straw/open mouth combo option! With that being said, my Owala does not keep water as cold for as long as a Hydroflask does. Unfortunately, I’m 7 days outside of my return window, otherwise I’d return it and buy a Hydroflask.",3
"I had bought my boyfriend an owala for Christmas and it is truly amazing. Easy to clean, keeps drinks cold, holds a decent amount of fluid and can still fit in a cup holder, convenient to carry, etc etc. I could go on and on about how amazing this cup is. My sister had also bought a cup and same thing, amazing. So I went and bought myself a cup for work. I ordered a brand new cup (NOT USED) and received it today. I opened my package and imagine my surprise when there wasn’t any stickers on the bottle indicating that it’s new (every bottle I’ve came in contact with has had the new stickers. There dirty residue on the lid of the bottle, and the inside was covered in water. You can see in the video the plastic bag that the package was wrapped in and out of frame was an Amazon shipping bag. There was no rain that could have caused the bottle to be wet. There was also a fowl Oder coming from the bottle. I still do love this brand and I’m excited to receive my replacement, but this is not it,,",3
"Love this bottle for many reasons it’s very convenient and love that the sip part is covered and protected. The outside rubber on the lid gets dirty very easily and depending what gets on it it can be hard to clean other than that I love it",3
"I have been on a mission to find the very best water bottle. I had settled on a glass bottle with a flip top cap, see through design, leak-proof, easy sip, and handsome exterior. But then I saw the Owala Bottle in a store.. First, the Owala's have a wonderful palate of colors, and handsome design. I love the size and look of the sipping part of the bottle......just the right amount of water. But what makes the Owala my new favorite is the stainless steel that makes the water taste wonderful, chilled all through the day. .not too cold, just right. What I do is set up the bottle in open mode, and sip from it throughout the day. Because of all these factors, I have been drinking more water. Even though the cap is open, the water remains chilled. I have two Owala bottles, and will order two more. The reason for 4 stars? The flip lids on my bottles don't work, so I just manually flip them open.....Perhaps they will loosen over time.",4
"I am very impressed with this 40 oz water bottle and its ability to keep water ice cold all day. I fill it about ⅓ full of ice, then water, and the ice will still be there the next morning, even if I refilled the water the day before. Frankly, that's the same performance I see from the Stanley Quencher that I also own, but the Owala is 100% spill-proof. The unique design of the Owala lid and drinking mechanism keeps all the liquid inside the bottle by having a cap that tightly seals the straw and drink openings.

The only gripe I have with the Owala is that the 40 oz. does not fit into a standard cupholder in my car. (For context, I drive a 2019 Honda Accord.) When traveling, I prefer the Stanley Quencher because of the tapered bottom that fits perfectly in a cup holder. Around the house, however, the Owala is my choice.

Nothing is perfect, but if you aren't concerned with the 40 oz. size not fitting into a car cup holder, you will love this well designed and engineered water bottle.",4
"I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY want to LOVE this water bottle. Just ordered a 3 rd ONE.
1 st was a return ""Thank You for giving this item a NEW life"" purchase BUT the lid would not close...arrived OPEN! Amazon please inspect returns! I put an obvious masking tape note ON IT
when I returned it!
2nd one ordered ...the BUTTON and SPRING for locking keeps popped off after 1 week only!
3 rd one just ordered...crossing my fingers 'cause I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY want to LOVE
this water bottle BUT if it FAILS again... 3 strikes and you're finished OWALA!",4
"I have a lot of containers from another company because they offer several styles of lids that are all interchangeable (chug, straws that's close, coffee, etc.). If my husband and I want to travel and share one container there is always an argument bc he only wants chug cap and I want straw. Now this has both options! It will now be our cup for bringing to airports. The reason for 4 stars is I was surprised to read once I got it says for cold and be cautious about hot liquids. All the others have ratings for hot and cold, but this one cold only. I plan to use for water, but does make it less versatile. Someone else complained their kid break the lids (they are plastic with moving parts) and claimed they don't sell replacements. Well they do on the Owala website, in many colors. I think lids were $7 and straws $2. So if it breaks don't have to waste the cup.",4
"I drink water all day long at work. I have used many tumblers. These have replaced my 40oz Yeti for work cups. I have been using them a couple of months. I love that they close so I don’t have a straw exposed to everyone at the nurses station. The handle is supper convenient. It is very easy to clean, not a lot of parts. They come in great colors. I’m not sure how long the opening mechanism will work. It just seems like I open and close it a lot. But so far it’s doing great.",4
"I bought this water bottle after seeing half my college campus walking around with them, and I haven't been disappointed. I exclusively use the straw and it's great for me, and I haven't had to deal with any leaks, even when I just toss the bottle into my passenger seat. The reason I needed another bottle was because I dropped my old one a little too often, and I was grateful that when I dropped this one the damage was limited to a few scratches. Hoping I don't see any dents soon but I'm not too worried.",4
"I am pretty happy with my bottle! It's easily portable and fits into my bag's side compartment-- or can just be my trusty emotional support bottle for the day.

The only con is that there is sometimes spillage/water jumping out when opening the bottle with the button feature.

It can also make a little bit of noise when you're in an quiet classroom when opening or close it.

Additionally, I also don't know if mines is simply defective, but the screwable top seems to be scratched easily + the side nubs that keep the carrier lock in seems to be slowly chipping out with the protective coat. (see pictures attached)

The scratches aren't super noticeable unless you are looking up close or taking flash photos.

It's only been a week since I've used it, so slightly concerning in terms of longevity.

Great bottle overall, would recommend but be a bit weary about the top's longevity and durability.",4
"It looks cute and sturdy. The bottle shape is a little weird, not fully rounded. I appreciate the price I got it at at the time.
My biggest qualm was shipping. Amazon sent it last minute through UPS, which got delayed. Then the kicker, it wasn’t in an actual box💀 it was packaged in a thin flimsy cardboard, no bubble wrap, warped and all from all the rain. Like come on now.. it’s a birthday gift. I’m grateful my mom likes it but the poor cup fighting for its life to get here.",4
"I bought Owala water bottles for my husband and son after seeing my sister’s Owala. They absolutely loved their Owalas so I ordered this one for myself. I love how cold it keeps the water - colder than my Contigo stainless steel bottles. I love the spout and the straw features. My son loves using the straw. My husband and I remove our straws. It’s very easy to clean. Nowhere available for hidden mold buildup. I took off 1 star because the bottle doesn’t fit in car cup holders which really is annoying. But it’s so great for everywhere else, I would HIGHLY recommend!",4
"Love this water bottle ngl, put ice in your water and the ice won't melt for a good 24 hours. Also the little flip handle on it has become a bit of a figet toy for me, which I like.

I've only had it about a month though and the little button you press to open the lid? Yeah the little bugger decided to fly off and hit me in the face, kinda hard actually. The spring they put in this thing is a bit stronger than I think it needs.",4
"I’ve been using reusable water bottles for over two decades. The Owala free sip is leaps and bounds better than any water bottle I’ve ever used. I will never buy another brand! The first one I bought was probably 3 years ago. It still works just as well now as it did the day I bought it. I’ve dropped it more times than I can count and never broken. I finally decided to broaden my horizons and purchase different colors. I will tell anyone who asks about the quality of these bottles. There’s something strangely satisfying about drinking from this bottle. The spout is shaped in a way that isn’t overwhelming sensory wise as it seems to be designed to fit the mouth. I always avoided cups with straws in the past because of the potential for bacterial growth and exposure. The design of these cups makes it easy to clean. My drinks stay cold for a long period of time.
I promise, you won’t regret buying this!
Side note, they say drinking out of the bottle makes you look like a koala, which is a great added bonus.",5
"I am absolutely thrilled with the Owala FreeSip Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle. This 32 oz bottle has become my go-to hydration companion, offering convenience, durability, and style all in one package.

First and foremost, the quality of this water bottle is outstanding. The stainless steel construction ensures durability and longevity, while the double-wall insulation keeps my drinks cold for hours on end. Whether I'm at the gym, on a hike, or running errands, I can always count on this bottle to keep my water refreshingly chilled.

The FreeSip straw design is a game-changer, allowing for easy, one-handed drinking without the need to tilt the bottle. The straw is BPA-free and provides a comfortable drinking experience, making it perfect for staying hydrated on the go.

I also appreciate the thoughtful design features of this bottle, such as the leak-proof lid and convenient carry handle. The camo cool design adds a touch of personality to my hydration routine, standing out from the crowd in style.

Since switching to the Owala FreeSip Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle, I've noticed a significant improvement in my hydration habits. The generous 32 oz capacity ensures I always have plenty of water on hand, encouraging me to stay hydrated throughout the day.

Overall, I couldn't be happier with this water bottle. If you're in search of a high-quality, stylish, and functional hydration solution, look no further. The Owala FreeSip Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle has earned its place as my hydration companion, and I give it a well-deserved five-star rating!",5
"In person the colors are every bit as vibrant as the image online (color I have is Summer Sweetness) and the bottle works great both at my desk during work hours or in the gym. Really appreciate the push button opening to prevent leaks and the carry loop makes it easy to carry when my hands are full. Have definitely found myself drinking more water at work because it stays cool and the straw makes sipping so easy! I have not tested how long it keeps things cool but haven't had any concerns about the water getting tepid.",5
"I saw the good reviews and gave this a try, and I LOVE it! Not only is it beautiful, with its gorgeous interplay of vivid colors, but it WORKS. To be honest, I wasn't sure how it could have an ""attached straw,"" but as soon as I tried to take a sip, I realized that it works. It works beautifully. The color combination I wanted came in a smaller form, so I usually have to refill it halfway through the day, but this water bottle makes taking a sip so easy and so carefree - the best quality (to me) is that when it's closed, this doesn't leak AT ALL. With the lock mechanism so easy to use, the pop-up top is easy to open and close, and that makes this my most carefree water bottle. I've started bringing it with me everywhere. (Oh, and it fits into my car's cup holder, which I cannot say for the ""Stanley Cup"" knockoff.) Such a great bottle - I'm probably going to buy a few more. Try one for yourself and see if you don't agree! Easy to hold, easy to carry, easy to use, and pretty!",5
"Love the concealed straw option, which makes staying hydrated a breeze! Cute color patterns for kids, making fun to use which keeping drinks cold all day. Easy to use, no leaking and easy to clean. Wishing there were more aesthetic color options for adults who aren’t into the color lock design. Would buy again!",5
"Love this water bottle. It’s good quality, &rivals other name brands. Priced a good $8-10 cheaper than more well known brands too. I read an article online praising this & ordered it as a result. Needless to say, I’m very pleased. It keeps cold beverages cold & there is no lead used in construction of this. I love the snap shut leak proof feature as well. It’s a tall & slender water bottle. The only thing I am not pleased with is that it isn’t for hot beverages, only cold. There is a built in straw & you can drink from it using the straw or tip it back to drink.",5
"Yes, this bottle prevents leaks and spills. Yes, this bottle keeps beverages cold. Yes, it has a great carrying handle and complimentary colors. But what really stands out about this one is how great it is to drink from. When I was a teacher, I had students who called their water bottle their comfort blanket. Never understood it until now. I don't like drinking out of a straw, but the opening for the straw is so perfect and convenient, I use it over the large opening. I'm drinking 3 bottles (32 oz bottle) a day now, way more than I ever have before. The water somehow tastes better (maybe how cold it is?) too making me more likely to drink. I've had other water bottles. Hated them all. But I LOVE this one and bring it everywhere",5
"When I was pregnant with my second daughter I was surprised when my doctor advised me to not drink from plastic or cook with non-stick. I did some research and we made changes, including converting to stainless steel water bottles. It has been so hard to find a good water bottle that is all stainless steel and doesn’t leak. Klean Kanteen is decent, but the silicone inserts that seal the lid break down over time and literally shred apart. If I’m paying a premium price, I don’t want a water bottle with a short lifespan. ThermoFlask is another decent option, but we’ve had the same issue with the lid seal breaking down, and also the straws seem to wear out. They get sort of scuffed up and discolored, and by the end of the day the water starts to have a funny plastic taste. Makes me wonder what the heck I’m marinating in my water all day. So we decided to give Owala a try, and for us, these are the best option we’ve found so far. The bottle itself is insulated stainless steel, and only the lid and straw are plastic. But they seem to be “better” plastic = super hard and durable plastic, including the straw which is rigid and does not bend (ThermoFlask plastic straws bend). Maybe this type of plastic is more resistant to wear and tear, I’m not sure, all I know is that we can leave water in the bottles for DAYS and it still tastes just like water, no funky flavors. I can stick all parts in the dishwasher over and over again, including the straw, and they come out clean and looking brand new every time, without stains. The silicone insert that seals the lid seems to be better designed and more resistant to breaking down than Klean Kanteen and Thermoflask. My girls love all the different fun color options, it’s nice to be able to chug if you are super thirsty, or keep the bottle upright to take a sip from the straw. Especially for our youngest, the straw feature is essential. And the bottles can take a beating, we’ve dropped them on sidewalks, hardwood floors, concrete, etc and they are still going strong. A note on sizing, the 24 oz and 32 oz sizes are actually the exact same height, it’s just the 24oz is a little thinner. I’ve included side-by-side photos. There really is not much physical difference between these two capacities, so we bumped up to the 32 oz for my daughter who is in first grade, since she was running out of water by the end of the school day with the 24 oz. The 32 oz still easily fits in the side pocket of her backpack, and it’s enough water for her to get through the day. Bottom line - these water bottles are durable, they function great, and they keep our water cold and fresh and free of funky flavors. Until someone cracks the code for a durable, 100% all stainless-steel water bottle with a straw that doesn’t leak, these are the go-to in our household. Highly recommend.",5
"I recently invested in a set of five Owala Water Bottles, and let me tell you, it was one of the best purchases I've made in a long time! These bottles are an absolute game-changer in terms of both functionality and style, earning a solid five-star rating from me.

First and foremost, the functionality of these bottles is unmatched. The innovative FreeSip® spout design allows for effortless one-handed drinking, which is incredibly convenient for someone like me who is always on the go. Plus, the integrated straw means I can enjoy every last drop of my favorite beverage without having to tilt the bottle – a feature I absolutely love! And with their spill-proof design, I can toss these bottles into my bag without worrying about any leaks or messes – a true lifesaver!

But it's not just about function – these bottles also score major points in the style department. The sleek, modern design is eye-catching and sophisticated, making these bottles a fashionable accessory wherever I go. Whether I'm hitting the gym, running errands, or simply lounging at home, I love showing off my Owala Water Bottle.

Another standout feature of these bottles is their durability. Made from high-quality, BPA-free materials, they can withstand daily wear and tear without missing a beat. I've accidentally dropped mine more times than I can count, and they've held up like champs every single time – no dents, no scratches, no leaks.

And let's not forget about the environmental impact. By using these reusable bottles instead of disposable plastic ones, I'm doing my part to reduce waste and minimize my carbon footprint – something that's important to me as a conscious consumer.

In summary, Owala Water Bottles have truly exceeded my expectations on every level. They're functional, stylish, spill-proof, and eco-friendly – what more could you ask for? If you're in the market for a new water bottle, do yourself a favor and invest in Owala. You won't be disappointed!",5
"I have super bad back pain as a recovering postpartum lady. So, I got myself a nice water bottle to treat myself and get myself motivated to drink enough water for my baby. Sounds silly, but I really wanted a cute water bottle. YEP. So, I got myself one of these and I LOVE IT. I already have owned two other Owala bottles prior, so I can say the quality is consistent, if not, continues to improve in these bottles.

They DO stay cold for hours if you put ice. If you leave it uncovered...well it doesn't stay insulated, so be aware of that. All through my pregancy and postpartum I have HAD to HAVE these bottles by my bed. I love it because I know how much water I'm drinking if I finish one of these bad boys and I track my water on an app.

Well, the only DOWNSIDE: Cleaning -- one time I left my postnatal pill on the lid of my owala water bottle and it melted and it took DAYS, ---yes DAYS of cleaning to get the smell and stain out. It was terrible. So don't get anything inside of it that ain't water. It isn't the easiest to clean off of the material for some reason.

Other than that I absolutely love the built in straw, and how CUTE this is. Do yourself a favor and get one!",5
"I purchased this Stanley tumbler because my daughter had one and loved it, so figured I'd love it too. I purchased it in October and really thought it was great. By mid-December I noticed a few drips from the ring around the lid. Then while traveling over the holidays I noticed the lid leaked immensely when my tote bag tipped over in the backseat of my vehicle. So, I ended up with a wet bag and contents. Now this morning...January 4th...only 3 months after purchase I arrived to work with a sopping wet tote bag as the lid leaked nearly half the water when my bag tipped over. The contents of my bag, vehicle seat, leather purse, hat and mittens are soaked. I'm done using this tumbler, it is not worth having a wet bag all the time. **For reference, I only hand wash this tumbler and only drink water from it...and it has never been dropped. It is in perfect condition, except for the profuse leaking...all.the.time. I submitted a claim to Stanley...we'll see if anything comes of it. :(",1
"We are a family of 5. To say that we have tried a vast number of water bottles/cups and tumblers is an understatement. I was super excited to try the widely talked about Stanley brand that it ended up on my birthday wish list. So my husband purchased my requested Stanley IceFlow Stainless Steel Tumbler with Straw 30oz. Upon arrival, it looked gorgeous, fit perfectly in my car's cup holder and it was easy to carry around. The first day, I filled it up with ice and water. I was home all day, in Florida, and it was great. I had a little over 1/3 of the ice left over the next day. The following day, I filled the cup up with ice and water once again. I headed off to the beach for the day. We set up our tent, I sat in the shade, along with my Stanley and within 4 hours, the ice had melted down to maybe 1/4 of the cup. As I stated in the beginning, we have had many cup/water bottles of various brands and never had I had one melt the ice so fast until this one. My children both play softball and baseball so we spend a lot of time, sometimes 10 hours, at a ball field. So we truly test our water bottles / cups on a regular basis. That said, I won't be purchasing any ""Stanley"" brand products again. Truly disappointed",1
"Review for: STANLEY IceFlow Stainless Steel Tumbler with Straw, Vacuum Insulated Water Bottle
I am changing my initial review. I just was told that these have lead in them. I didn't believe that a product could be sold with lead in it anymore. We have moved past lead paint, why would I find it in my water bottle? So I did some research of my own because I don't want to just believe this from someone that read something. And guess what I found? They do contain lead! And...it states that the only way that the lead would leech out into the drink is if the cup were damaged!!! So, I am sending both of my cups back. The sellers should be up front about this and let the buyers decide what they are doing. No thanks, I will find a cup without lead.",1
"Edit: this item contained lead. Being covered doesn’t mean lead won’t eventually contaminate you and your other items. Imagine you’re spending this poison to all your dishes in thr dishwasher? Look up Stanley cups contain lead via search engine or go on lead safe mamas website to read more. Stanley please DO BETTER!

Original review:
Finally went for it as everyone had one which typically makes things unappealing. I tried other brands and they just don’t keep your drink cool or feel as quality. I’m a fan now & wish I went with Stanley in the first place. I got a 30oz size in pale pink with an ivory handle (the type of handle is great for those with busy schedules or young kids too) & it’s so good looking in the perfect size without feeling heavy.",1
"I love Stanley and was very excited to purchase this for my son. It came “used-like new”, not original packaging, which is fine. No scratches or dents and it was delivered on time and delivery was flawless.
What isn’t fine is the fact that it was delivered sealed in a bag and contained liquid. The previous owner left their drink in the Stanley and no one noticed??? That is awful quality control. Still waiting to hear from customer service on how to handle this. It needs to be trashed, not returned so it doesn’t happen to someone else.
I ordered 2 other Stanley’s from Amazon as gifts and I would give them 5 stars.",1
"I bought this big boy so I had water throughout the day. I manage construction and am in/out of the office, in/out of the field. This sucker obviously does not fit in a cup holder, or anything for that matter. It constantly would end up in the floor, rolling around. Note a big deal for me as my Yeti water bottles in the past have. What sucks about this is it leaks like a sieve. No matter how tight the lid is, it will leak the ENTIRE volume of water… All over the floor or seat. I don’t use this anymore. It won’t stay upright when driving through site so there is no point for me to use it any longer… Bummer.",1
"I have used Stanley vacuum products for FIFTY YEARS! Never expected them to have quality control issues. ALL THREE LEAKED. The THIRD replacement arrived with NO box and had DENTS from Amazon sloppy shipping. (Stanley, you need to control manufacture, supply and shipping better!) Wonderful design, BUT it leaks. TURNED OVER IN MY VEHICLE AND LEAKED ALL OVER THE FLOOR! VERY disappointed. Was perfect except for all the mess. The ""off brands"" are cheaper and actually DON'T LEAK.",1
"I bought this as a birthday gift for my daughter, thinking it would keep her water ice cold throughout the day, but it doesn't. The ice barely last a couple of hours. My Yeti and many other off-brands are insulated much better and hold ice for several hours (even overnight). Not impressed at all, what is the big hype/trend all about?",1
"Learned after purchase, and after being sent to grandson that this product, creates mold around the straw area and has to be meticulously disassembled to be cleaned after every use to prevent this from happening. I learned this from a video and it is entirely confirmed. I am sorry that I purchased this. Thanks for listening and have a good day.",1
"In the morning after filling my stanley cup with ice and water there is less ice than the Arctic cups I got at Walmart. Also not sturdy if you drop it. I accidentally knocked mine off a machine at the gym to a carpeted floor the first day I used it and the handle bent and chipped the plastic on the handle. I fell on concrete and broke my wrist and dented my attic cup but it worked perfectly afterwards. I will not buy another Stanley cup. I will stick to the Walmart. Cups. I was very disappointed.",1
"I purchased the STANLEY IceFlow 30 oz, and it did NOT stand up to the description. The description stated iced beverages stay cold up to 2 days, but it couldn’t even keep ice for more than 4 hours! I put 4-6 ice cubes and refrigerated water in mine, but the ice melted rather quickly, and the water did not stay cold. I tried it for a couple days, but nope, still a fail. Previously had a Hydracentials bottle, which worked great, but I had to replace the lid about every 6-8 months because of air leakage. Received another Hydracentials for a gift, but that one didn’t keep water cold any better than a glass w/ ice. I returned the Stanley, and I bought a Yeti Rambler directly from the Yeti site. Fingers crossed that this works better than the Hydracentials and the Stanley. I do not recommend the Stanley if you are looking for a water bottle to keep your water cold for more than a couple of hours.",2
"At first I loved this tumbler and it encouraged me to drink more water. Then I put it in my gym bag. Everything was soaked and I had to go to work with a wet bra and scrubs. I figured it was my fault and that I didn’t screw the cap on correctly. Then it happened again. I had my Stanley in a tote bag in the backseat of my car. It tipped over and I legitimately had a puddle on my backseat and everything was soaked. I checked it and the lid was on properly. It’s so sad because it keeps water so cold and is very cute but not worth the hype and price. My yeti in the same style doesn’t leak at all. Will definitely be sticking with Yeti. For reference I’ve had my yeti for 8 months and it has gone through the dishwasher multiple times. My Stanley is 2 months old and only gets hand washed.",2
"I will be keeping because of the color & the convenience of the handle for the gym BUT - super disappointed. I filled it with slushy ice water last night before bed, brought it into my bedroom with me, didn’t open it all night - also keep in mind I keep the air-conditioning on in my room all year long and it’s about 30° outside so it’s FREEZING in my room. I woke up this morning & my ice cold slushy water was room temperature. I also have a Zenbo from Amazon as well and the quality of that $18 tumbler is of no comparison to this one which is double the price. The Zenbo keeps my drinks cold for 13+ hours, I still had ice in mine the following morning so I guess I will be using the Stanley for the gym since I’m there less than 2 hours & will continue to use my Zenbo. Just was hoping if the Zenbo was phenomenal, that the Stanley would be superior & unfortunately I was wrong. I cannot drink room temperature water so I ended up dumping it in the dogs bowl. So if you’re looking for temperature control - this is not it. If you like it for the colors & the name - then get it. But not for quality.",2
"Pros: comes in lots of colors, the top is easy to screw on and feels sturdy. It holds liquid.

Cons: priced 2.5x as much as my normal go to insulated tumbler (which is the 26 oz TAL Ranger from Walmart $14), the top takes up a lot of interior space leading to overflows if you’re not careful, difficult to take a drink on the go because the handle (and my hand) are in the way, sweats on the outside even in 73 degree a/c, is very heavy, did not prove to be 100% leak proof. But most importantly, I’ve already wasted a gallon of Publix sweet tea because the ice melts in a matter of hours. It claims to hold ice for two days but this is false. I bought three of these for the price of 7.5 Rangers. After three days I’m back to using my Ranger. My daughter is the catalyst here. Apparently everyone in fifth grade has one of these Stanley’s. She does take ice water to school every day and this will likely suffice for that. But if I could return all 3, I would.",2
"I read a few articles coming out lately of class action lawsuits and complaints regarding the lead in the top of this cup around where it locks & closes. I’m pretty concerned because minimal or not LEAD IS STILL IN THE CUP!!! On top of that, this cup does not keep liquids cold as long as advertised. I kept some ice and water in the closed cup over night for about 8 hours, took a sip, and was surprised to feel it was room temperature and the ice melted. Lead is such an avoidable, inexpensive material that should not be used in something we as consumers will use DAILY. Many brands do not use this (I’ll avoid saying names). Do your research and find other less hyped options.",2
"I thought I was going to love this as I used to have one and it lasted me for years. The only need to replace it was due to loss. But just a few uses in. I started struggling with the lid and the long drive had it the more I've struggled and now the cup leaks. That's the reason I bought the cup specifically. Is its leak proof in addition to all the other features. There are lots of cups that stay cold and are durable. I really want to leak proof one... Oh and another reason I bought it is it's dishwasher safe but the only thing I can think of is maybe it's not. Have only ever washed all pieces on the top rack and without the heat dry. My old Stanley had been washed in the dishwasher for years, dropped over and over again and never had any problems closing or leaking. I think it's the brand because this was my experience with my last cup, different size and different color. It's a bummer because I'll be switching to hydro flask after being a Stanley customer for years... But I don't do leaks or complications. I want a cup that's durable enough to be used pretty much constantly except for when it's being washed in the dishwasher and for it to be able to go into my purse, a bag, bed, anywhere without leaking or being damaged. Stanley you stop for that. And the one I'm comparing it to that lasted for years and would probably still would work if I hadn't lost, I found at a goodwill! So who knows how long it was used or how it was treated before me!",2
"I had a Simple Modern bottle for about 7-8 years. I only bought this because like all elementary school girls it's a huge fad and my daughter wanted one. So I figured mine was old I'd get myself one also. This is no where near the same quality as the cheaper Simple Modern bottles. I have to add ice 1-2 times a day with this. Simple Modern I filled the ice and it would last at least 2 days. Very disappointed in this brand.",2
"Honestly this water bottle is terrible. I found that strange since everyone is talking about it. I gave it a full year to test and I still hate it. The flip up straw is hard to pull up and push down (this might be just mine) but I feel like I was also worried about it getting dirty. The water bottle doesn't keep ice cold very long. Especially in the summer. Maybe a few hours. Definitely not how it should be. And I dropped it a few months back and the bottom cracked and I just found out that they use lead and when the bottom cracks you are exposed to lead. Not safe at all. I really wish I hadn't bought it because I feel like it is a waste of money.",2
"After waiting and waiting for this cup because it was out of stock for awhile. ..I finally received it and was very disappointed. It was discolored in several spots. Also the straw doesn't stay firmly in the lid. I have sent an email to Stanley with the pics so we'll see if they make this right.",2
"I got this for my young daughter. The first one came in and the logo on the cup had a misprint. Submitted for an exchange and the second one came in with the handle completely bent. The shipping box was not damaged at all which tells me someone packed it damaged. I tried to bend it back and it is not budging. So I took the lid of the first order and the bottle of the second creating. All this hype for this product is causing them to rush manufacturing and skip quality control seems like…",2
"I do have to say I like the Stanley insulated cup, I tend to call them sippy cups because this is what I gave my son when he was little, not the Stanley but similar cups. It does keep my drink cold and ice cubes in it overnight and into the next day. My husband did buy me the large 40 oz one but I thought it was quite bulky to carry around, I'm not quite sure why people do. So I bought the smaller one. The larger one was very difficult to use while I was driving. It does say it is leak proof but it is only leak proof if the drinking spell is down if the drinking spell is up liquid does pour out the center of it so this one is not totally leak proof. I do like the carrying handle, I like the fact that there is not a straw sticking out of it, I like that I can pull the drinking mechanism flip up and down. I do like the cup but I have to say I'm not quite sure what all of the hype is it is simply an insulated cup I do have other insulated cups that keep my ice and my cup overnight and most of the day. So I'm not sure why people are fighting over them. So I did give it a three star because it doesn't leak if you have the drinking mechanism up so if it tips over while you're driving you will spill your drink all over your car. Also I'm not quite sure what makes this so special than every other cup.",3
"I love this because it keeps my water so cold while I’m at work! Everything is great except when I put the drinking spout into the closed position (so it doesn’t leak in my work bag) it is nearly impossible to flip the drinking spout back to the open position. It leaks in my bag nearly every day despite being upright and wedged next to my lunch bag. Thankfully, it’s just water. I found the same one as this at Nordstrom Rack today and tried the drinking spout on that one and it opened and closed with no problem. It was already past the return date when I received it as a Christmas gift, so I guess I will just have to live with it. I guess I just got a one with a faulty drinking spout.",3
"I’m a teacher and Stanley’s are so popular. I got mine and honestly it’s okay. I’ve had better water bottles in the past. Gets the job done, but in my opinion is just like a regular water bottle. The ice doesn’t last too long and if you keep refilling it with water, ice will melt very quickly. I get a lot of compliments on it because of the color and I use it often because it was so expensive but I prefer my old Contigo thermal water bottle. Summers where I live are usually around 110° and my and the Contigo water bottle kept ice all day while sitting in my car in the summer. I would not buy an a Stanley again because they are much better and cheaper options out there.",3
"We own four other Stanley cups, and they are fabulous! This one, not so much or maybe I’m expecting too much. This one just doesn’t seem to measure up. It doesn’t keep my water cold more than five or so hours. I drink a lot of water and I’m constantly having to add ice because this thing will NOT keep ice frozen. I can fill it with ice and it melts within four to six hours. It said that it would keep ice for two days. Laughable! I saw see other reviews saying the same thing. Good things? It doesn’t leak, easy to carry and it’s cute! Good luck!",3
"It's a cute cup..love the color, but it does not perform as advertised. It's supposed to keep cold water cold for like 7 hours and my cold water after not even 2 hours is not so cold anymore. Also, it is supposed to keep ice for 2 days and that is also false advertising. I have to fill my cup with ice multiple times a day.
If I had not paid $35 for the cup I would not mind so much. I want my $35 worth of outstanding Stanley quality...as advertised.
Is that too much to ask?",3
"The product is very nice and exactly what I wanted, but it is not right to wrap a fragile and sensitive product in a simple inflatable bag and send it to the other side of the world. My product is damaged. Why should I use a defective product even though I paid full money for it? Amazon should improve itself in this regard, and in a short time. That's why I'm giving it a low score.",3
"I recently purchased the purple Stanley water bottle
it's super cute and highly functional. The design with the handle at the top makes it easy to carry, and the purple color adds a nice touch of style.

However, I have to admit that durability was put to the test as I tend to drop it quite often. In their defense, the bottle did get a small dent at the bottom. Despite the accidental mishaps, the bottle held up relatively well.

Another problem I faced was the temperature. It didn't keep the ice cold at all. The ice melted in seconds.

If you are looking to get the popular Stanley Cup, this came exactly as it looked and was super cute. If you want it for the looks I did I would 100 percent get it, but if you want a higher quality I would opt for something else

In conclusion, the Stanley water bottle is an excellent choice for those who appreciate aesthetics",3
"Took quite a while to show up, has a couple dings and scratches even though it was packaged nicely. I was going to order a replacement but it said it'd be 1 to 2 mths so I decided just to keep this one incase that one was worse and I didn't want to not have one.... but for the price of these cups, they should be flawless.... so that was disappointing",3
"I literally have no words for whomever decided throwing 250 of these in boxes and putting paper over them would be sufficient for protection and receiving. We bought these as staff gifts, and almost every single one of them has an abrasion on it from how these were packed. I've honestly never seen anything like it! Don't get me wrong, receiving the first wave of these in one business day is great, but not at the expense of damaging this product, especially considering the (very) expensive price we paid!!!",3
"Holds water and temperature great for me, but I fold mold/black stuff underneath the seal of the lid a lot and it isn't that easy to clean since the spout does not come off easily so that you can clean it better.

If all you drink is pure water then it might be good, but if you mix stuff in it like G-Supps/Gfuel/Liquid IV I would look elsewhere.",3
"Gave it four stars because it DOES leak. But I got it for my baby to carry for her warm water for her formula since she dislikes cold or room temperature. It keeps her water warm for about 9 hours. I like it minus the leaking but it’s not that big of a deal. If you don’t mind the leaking I’d say it’s a pretty great size. Lasts me all day if we are out or visiting family.",4
"I got the 64oz size. I like this because I only have to fill it up once a day and I like that it is dishwasher safe. So far, no leaks and it keeps my water cold. My water tastes fresh all day and therefore helps me drink how much I should in one day. I have heard that Stanley has lead in there products, that makes me uneasy. The water bottle is also pricey-over 50 bucks. I plan to keep using it daily because it is helping me meet my goals.",4
"This was bought as an open box with no cosmetic damage about $7 under reg price. It was shipped in a paper envelope and I heard the metal hit my porch as it was delivered. When took a look I had a dent on the side and a bit of damage to the top. So either the description was inaccurate or the packaging was so poor in was dented in shipping.

Both flaws are small but I am still disappointed cause I would not have picked this up in this condition from the store.

The water bottle is otherwise super cute. This is our favorite water bottle and the handle makes it super easy to use.",4
"I recently added the STANLEY IceFlow Stainless Steel Tumbler with Straw to my daily routine, and I must say, it's a game-changer! This tumbler is a stellar combination of functionality, durability, and style.

First and foremost, the stainless steel construction is top-notch. Not only does it give the tumbler a sleek and modern look, but it also ensures incredible durability. I love how it can withstand the hustle and bustle of my daily life, whether I'm on the go or at my desk.

The IceFlow technology is a real standout feature. My drinks stay refreshingly cold for hours, even on the hottest days. The double-wall vacuum insulation is a game-changer, maintaining the temperature of my beverage without any annoying condensation on the outside.",4
"Love the color and it’s definitely leak proof , I would like to test out the ice situation because my ice melts in less than an hour not sure why (I’ll update the review ) but the cup is pretty amazing I love it ! Seriously do

Update **

The ice was the problem , I changed it and it definitely works it’s been more than 10 hour and ice is the same my drink is still cold ! Definitely worth it",4
"I bought this because I needed something with a handle. The colors are great, thete are some imperfections that annoy me. The logo isn't centered, the seam is noticeable and there are random lines at the bottom of the cup that are not part of the design. (See my photos)
I was surprised to find out that the ice doesn't stay solid for more than 8 hours. It does keep the luqiud cold. I have used it for hot liquid, so I cannot comment on that. For the price, I would probably purchase a Yeti.",4
"I’ve fallen into the teal of this Stanley cup BS- I was going to complete my collection with this one- and ordered it in the white so it would match my other tumblers- but I got the tangerine color. Still SUPER cute and this is an awesome water bottle. 10/10",4
"I love the cup but hate the packaging or should I say lack of packaging. It came with a small piece of brown paper around it in an amazon box that's it. It's a gift so I am glad it was not scratched. That is the reason for a 4 star.",4
"When I'm working out and *need* water NOW, the internal straw size lets me down. Due to having TMJ and needing a lot of flow in a short amount of time, I find that my jaw pops with each pull. If I wasn't working out and could sip like a normal person (my tween and husband LOVE theirs and have no complaints at all), this wouldn't be an issue. But as is, I can't use it for the intended purpose.",4
"I purchased 3 different tumbles, two for my wife and I and another for a gift.. They are genuine Stanley Tumblers but they are sold by Amazon which makes me think that Amazon buys them in bulk from Stanley.. They will have dings and scuffs from banging around with other tumblers.. At the end of the day they will get that from everyday use but still kinda discouraging that you buy something new and it’s already a little beat up when you get it. All that aside, I really like the tumbler a lot, the flip up straw is a bit stiff but the water flow is smooth when drinking.",4
"I like the colors SO MUCH, they're super retro, and the cream color is *chef's kiss* perfect, and it fits my retro aesthetic perfectly :) Keeps my water icy cold all day, I like that you can collapse the ""straw"" thing, which makes it feel more sanitary than the cups that have the straw sticking straight up at all times. Super easy to clean, it's heavy, but it helps me stay hydrated so yay. I also like the Stanley brand, they can take a beating and still hold up pretty well.",5

"in my opinion the best yet stanley tumbler. ✨ it’s made of recycled fishing nets (my biggest conservation interest), i adore the leak proof flip straw, it keeps my ice for 2 entire days, the 30oz is perfect if you’re petite/have small hands/aren’t very strong, the handle makes it easy to carry around everywhere, it holds ice to the top and a normal sized water bottle perfectly, the color selection is immaculate especially on amazon (i bought a second one in the plum stripe color tonight), and it’s sweat proof. next i think i’ll be purchasing a 64oz in the charcoal or lavender just to have on hand for long trips, beach days, camping, etc.

i really can’t imagine a more perfect every day water bottle. the only con for me is they did that collab with starbucks in the beginning of this year and with the goings on in 🇵🇸 🍉 i really did not like that - if you know you know - but making this from the recycled fishing nets is really something im glad to support because saving our oceans and our planet is so important and i wish more big corporations would be willing to participate and do the same. the fishing industry and the nets they litter everywhere are the biggest cause of oceanic pollution, there’s millions of giant fishing vessels 🚢 net sweeping the entire ocean floor at every second of every day killing every animal caught inside including endangered & non target species such as dolphins, sea turtles, & thousands of others. this continuous hacking at our oceans has reduced our coral reef and fish populations along with algae production by 70% in the last 50 years (most of the worlds oxygen comes from algae). their nets are the number ONE source of plastic in our oceans making up 80% of the plastic found at sea (straws only make up 1% for reference). so thank you stanley for doing something helpful to our planet! 🌎 🌊",5
"I bought this as a gift for my husband because we travel a lot this was only purchased for car travel and running around.

The bottle is super good quality! It's solid,feels secure, and he tells me the thing he loves most is that it's super easy to drink out of. Be calls it the drink flow lol (he's a bit weird).
It also does a really nice job of keeping his water cold for quite a while so he can better work on his 8 cups per day. It's light and easy to carry around.

It is more expensive than other options but it works great and was a great purchase.",5
"I LOVE THIS WATER BOTTLE!!! As every teen and adult has more than likely seen this on tiktok or in school, its super popular and super good. But one con with the regular stanley (not this product but the one with the side handle) is that it leaks, which is why I decided to buy the flip straw instead. I also bought this because it seems more heavy duty, and just incase its another Hydroflask situation where its popular for a year then its a new water bottle, It just seemed like this wouldnt be as weird to carry around when the trend dies down. I got the swirl purple because I liked lapis, lavender and iris, so i just got them all in one cup! This cup DOESNT LEAK!!! People who say that the straw doesnt line up with the logo is due to them turning it tight. I just turned the lid to the logo, and it was still waterproof. And the packaging is.. bad. Dont think ""hey these boxes look badly packaged, but Im sure my carrier will pack it better!"" because it was my same thought and just know they only put the plastic air bags. The waterbottle comes as seen in the first image. Mine didnt come dented or scratched thanks to a caring delivery driver. I also put my name in vinyl on it because this bottle is EXPENSIVE and I dont want to lose it!! It blends in a bit, So im going to change it to silver. The straw is a bit difficult to open, but its not a inconvenience personally. Super easy to clean, and ⚠️BE AWARE⚠️ that yes they do put a sticky tab right on top of the stanley logo, and if you get a bottle that doesnt have the stanley logo IN SILVER, be EXTREMELY careful when peeling. Only saying because the stanleys that have silver logos are ENGRAVED and stanleys with colored logos are PRINTED/PAINTED ON making it more likely to peel with sticky tab. I also wouldnt reccomend dishwashing because it can make the bottle scratch easier (said in handbook inside stanley cup.) But honestly, the lifetime warranty is a great catch which is something I like. This bottle fits in my backpack. 10/10 would recommend!!!",5
"The Stanley IceFlow Tumbler sets a new standard for convenience and functionality in beverage containers. Featuring a top handle design, it effortlessly outshines traditional tumblers with side handles, offering unparalleled versatility and ease of transport.

One of its standout features is the leak-proof design, ensuring that your beverage stays securely contained, even when you're on the move. The ability to close the mouthpiece adds an extra layer of protection against spills, allowing you to enjoy your drink without any worries.

The vibrant color adds a splash of personality to this already impressive tumbler, making it not just a practical accessory, but a stylish statement piece as well. The fact that you patiently waited two months for it to come back in stock speaks volumes about its desirability and quality.

In conclusion, the Stanley IceFlow Tumbler is well worth the wait. Its combination of versatile design, leak-proof construction, and eye-catching aesthetics make it an essential companion for anyone with an active lifestyle. Whether you're commuting, hiking, or simply out and about, this tumbler is sure to become your go-to choice for keeping your beverages at the perfect temperature while on the move.",5
"I was a little worried when I bought it since a bunch of comments said that it arrived damaged. But omg, IT ARRIVED PERFECTLY! (almost). It only has microscopic scratches that are so hard to see. The handle arrived a little dirty but I washed it and it came off. I LOVE the rose gold. It’s more like a pale rose! I thought that a little bit of the logo would come off since it happened to certain persons. Over all I give it five stars! love this ❤️",5
"I am not the person to jump on a trend. I run a short term rental at my home and a guest left a hydroflask some months ago. Unable to reach them to return it to them I decided I might as well put it to use since I actually needed a good water bottle. I loved how it kept the water but I did not love the weight or the fact that it didn’t fit in the cup holder of my car. One of my students suggested this one with the handle on top to me one day in class when it came up that I was in the market for a new water bottle and I have to say, she did me a solid. This meets all of my needs perfectly (and prettily).",5
"This is definitely one of my best purchases ever and it’s not bc it’s a Stanley Is because of the good quality and a effective way to use it making easy to take everywhere my water can be up to 8 hours cold (my shift work) and I’m so happy with it 😭🤍 I been drinking so much water since this cup came to my life lol",5
"I purchased this tumbler not because the fad because honestly I had no clue about these tumblers. I was looking for a spill proof cup with a straw and was looking for a beige color originally. This came up in my search results and I really liked the color. So I gave it a go and I’m happy I did so . I like the fact it has a handle and the flip straw . It keeps my drink cold and isn’t so large it feels awkward carrying it . I went with the 22 ounce for that reason . Packaging wasn’t the best but other than that it’s awesome.",5
"I’ve been using screen protectors for my phones for over 10 years and I’ve never had one be so poor that it legitimately cracked my actual phone screen!!

Let’s start by saying I do drop my phone a decent amount because I live a pretty active lifestyle! I always keep my phone in a case and have my screen protected because I know how I am! By no means am I intentionally dropping/throwing my phone or dropping it from great heights etc.

I bought this set of 3 in June 2023 to replaced my old cracked tempered glass screen protector. I had generally bought expensive ones but this had good reviews and I wanted to try and save money because when comparing what I had it seemed almost identical!
After replacing my old screen protector with one from this set I proceeded to notice I had more trouble than ever putting it on. It didn’t seem to line up or lay flat. My phone was less than a year old and had no cracks so I assumed I was the problem. (Note: I followed all instructions and kept everything CLEAN.) I wasn’t sure why I couldn’t get at least one of the dime sized bubbles out no matter how hard I tried and eventually had to accept it.
I don’t remember exactly how long it took before I dropped my phone but the very first drop my screen protector cracked. I kept that particular screen protector on for a little while (dropped a few times after and the cracks only got worse which is when I always change protectors.) I replaced that broken screen protector for a second one in that set. The same exact thing happened with it not fitting properly! I had it out of my case etc. to put it on and there was no reason it wasn’t fitting! (I almost threw the entire screen protector out and tried a new one!) One edge had crumbled on the first screen protector so I ordered a new phone case prior to putting the second screen protector on thinking maybe that was the issue. (It wasn’t.) Within a few days I dropped my phone and the screen again cracked and after a couple months or less it also shattered and chipped just like the other one.
Eventually the fact I couldn’t see my actual phone screen because of the lifting drove me so crazy I took it off with intentions of replacing screen protector two with screen protector three of the set and while prepping my phone I realized the crack and shattering/crumbling of the glass wasn’t just the screen protector it was my actual phone screen!!

My phone NEVER ONCE fell out of my phone case etc. the edges of my phone are covered by my case and I’ve used the same type of phone case (same brand and/or style just a different size/model) for probably 8 years or more and I’ve never had an issue with my actual phone screen (not screen protector) getting cracked/damaged!

Now it’s February 2024 and I just put screen protector number three on for the time being. The funniest/weirdest part is the screen protector actually fits better now that my screen is cracked. It took me over 15 minutes to get it to line up “properly” and I have the least amount of bubbles yet but I don’t know how long that will last since I have a crack starting from the edge (where my screen crumbled from what I believe was the screen protector crumbling into my screen) all the way through the long distance of my screen to the other edge of where the screen protector stopped. (Not my screen, the screen protector because the thing doesn’t cover the entire screen like it should)

And to make things more annoying this screen protector doesn’t even cover my front camera like the original one I bought these to replace. Honestly it’s probably a blessing since my phone cracked where the screen protector was.
The front facing camera was my biggest concern when I received these screen protectors because I was so worried it would get cracked being exposed but now its proof to me that the screen protector was what damaged my screen.

So in my opinion it’s better to pay a little extra because this will definitely cost me more in the long run!
I already contacted the company but it is a little annoying Amazon doesn’t offer any help other than giving you the website of the company. I had already found that and additional info on my own before even looking into Amazon’s customer service options. Amazon didn’t even offer me a direct communication option with the company just a link to go figure it out myself and hope the company gets back to you. I’ve seen that a lot in the past with Amazon and that’s how I knew to contact the company before checking Amazon. I understand but also it’s slightly disappointing Amazon doesn’t have more options to help their customers and keep companies they partner with accountable.",1
"Update to review below - I finally got around to changing my screen protector from my previous one. Imagine my surprise when I went to put it on my 14 pro, and found a 2-3mm gap all the way around the protector. It looks ugly af. And please don’t say “but that’s room for the case!” No case I have needs a 2-3mm gap to work. Other screen protectors I’ve used have a 1mm gap and that works perfectly. Returning these.

I’ve used this brand before for a few different phone models. I do wish it came with the frame for easy installation, but I have another one from a previous kit. They do the job.

The box though - why make it harder to open? It has this silly little “press here to open” a little bit up the back - one, it doesn’t press to open (I was afraid of breaking the screen protectors just trying to get the box open), two, you still have to rip the bottom of the box open to get the screen protectors out. Silly. Sometimes “new” and “innovative” really isn’t.",1
"Annoyed to begin with that this has a strip on it for opening that reads ""Easy Open"" - was not at all obvious how to get that strip to tear and then the perforation didn't work so ultimately had to tear it off, but after tearing it open, I couldn't figure out how to get the glass protectors out of the box without tearing it some more. Please don't put messages liek ""Easy Open' on a box when it's not the case,,, 2nd, as far as I can tell there are no instructions on how to use/install these. There were a bunch of decals that fell out the box that I don't think are necessary. There is a brown card with tiny print on it (why is paper and ink so expensive that print needs to be so small it's unreadable?), that maybe have instructions, but the print is so small I can't read it even with my reading glasses on. Why manufacturers are so inconsiderate of their customers I don't know, but I thought this was so rude, I decided a few words of complaint were due...",1
"Absolutely not a fan of this brand of screen shield. After applying the first shield to my new iPhone 15 Pro, I noticed a small thin “bubble” going around the edge of the screen. This is because the shield is not making contact with the edge of the phones screen. This is what is called the “Halo Effect.”

Ailun includes a little note in each box (pictured), that explains the halo effect is caused by a warped iPhone screen. I found that a bit odd since I’ve never experienced a halo on any of my previous iPhones and I have a hard time believing that Apple doesn’t know how to make a flat screen.

I tried the 2nd Ailun screen shield thinking that maybe I needed to prep my iPhone more but the 2nd shield also suffered from a halo bubble. I didn’t even bother trying to install the 3rd shield.

I went ahead and paid extra for a WSKEN brand glass shield and, lo and behold, one attempt and NO halo effect whatsoever. I think it’s a bit disingenuous for Ailun to try and blame Apple and claim the iPhone screen is warped when the screen shields from other manufacturers fit flawlessly.

Ailun may be the cheaper option, but you get what you pay for. I recommend paying a little extra and getting a more reliable screen shield. If not for the halo effect, this would have been a 5 star product for me.",1
"I am extremely disappointed that I have now had not one but TWO iPhone 13 mini screens break within a few weeks while supposedly protected by the Ailun Glass Screen Protector. In the cases, the glass should not have broken even without a screen protector.

The first time, the screen shattered beneath the Ailun screen protector after falling from waist level into relatively soft dirt. Maybe it hit a pebble, but there is no way that the screen should have shattered at that height and impact, and it's an indictment both of Apple and of Ailun. The second time, a small plastic light fell about two feet (the height of my monitor) onto the iPhone on my desk, shattering the screen and screen protector in the same place near the front camera. Perhaps this is a weak spot on the screen protector or iPhone screen, but either way this should never have happened, let alone two times.

To make matters worse, the Ailun Customer Service webpage is not functioning properly (it simply displays “Processing,please wait…” after I click “Submit”, and the company has not even responded to my emails about this issue.

Given these problems with Ailun quality, as well as the company's broken support website and refusal to even reply to my emails, I strongly warn you against buying this product.",1
"I ended up having to use all 3 protectors in one week. So disappointing. First application: bubbles at the edge that wouldn’t dissipate so I took it off and put a fresh one. The second one lasted a few days then it chipped and cracked on the left side. I have never once cracked a phone or protector before so was really shocked that that happened. In general I avoid roughhousing my phone and this cracked by me placing it face down on my bathroom counter. Now I’m on my third and last protector. Application left some small bubbles but I guess it’s better than nothing.",1
"I have used these screen protectors in the past. They are cheap, but they definitely do the job. I bought some last month and 2 broke! Now, I have an Otterbox case on my phone. I am very careful with my phone and I rarely drop it.

On both occasions, it was a normal day and I happened to glance at my phone to see a hairline fractue and a crack on a corner….as I mentioned, I had not dropped my phone.

After the first one broke, I thought it was a faulty one. I applied the second one and the SAME THING happened. I tried to contact the company and they kept telling me that I had purchased them from another “company”

"This is my second attempt at an inexpensive glass protector for my phone. The first brand lasted three weeks. The Allun wins--it lasted less than two before cracking and creating a small hole in a shattered pattern.

No, the phone didn't fall or hit anything.

Two other covers come in the package, but why would I try a second one and lose my return window period?

I also didn't like how the cover so quickly picked up finger prints. But I would have lived with that.

Back to the grand search for a decent product.",1
"I went through all three that came in the package just to get it to stick to my phone with no bubbles, and even then it required me to unstick and stick the final one I had several times for the large bubbles to disappear. There are still small bubbles and some dust trapped under it because I had to do this, but I have no more screen protectors to try it again. Additionally, it was also almost impossible to line it up correctly because the ""guide stickers"" they provide are useless and the instructional video they have is no help, either. Steer clear unless you work at a phone store and put screen protectors on phones multiple times a day, because that is clearly who this product is designed for.",1
"It does not protect the screen because it is weaker than the screen itself. It is a junk.
I bought my phone a couple months before I purchased this item. Before using this item the screen did not get any scratch. But after I put this protector on, it got cracked within a week. It looked ugly but I kept it on. Less than a week, I got another split near front camera.
It came with pack of 3. So I shared with my son. The same thing happened to my kid’s cellphone.",1
"As a longtime iPhone user, I've always been cautious about protecting my precious device from scratches and cracks. When I came across the Ailun Glass Screen Protector for iPhone 15 Pro Max, I was intrigued by its promise of durability and clarity. However, my experience with this product has been far from satisfactory.

From the very beginning, the installation process was a hassle. Without an alignment frame or any smoothing tool, I found it challenging to apply the screen protector without air bubbles. The instructions were vague and unhelpful, leaving me to rely on trial and error to achieve a bubble-free application.

Despite my best efforts, I was unable to completely eliminate the air bubbles. Even after carefully following the instructions, I was left with several small bubbles along the edges of the screen. These bubbles were not only unsightly but also interfered with the smooth operation of the touchscreen.

To make matters worse, the screen protector lifted at the corners after just a few days of light use. The edges of the protector felt sharp and uncomfortable, and I was constantly worried about the protector detaching completely.

Overall, my experience with the Ailun Glass Screen Protector has been disappointing. The product's lack of ease of use, its tendency to lift at the corners, and the absence of essential installation tools make it far from a worthwhile investment. I would not recommend this product to anyone seeking a reliable and user-friendly screen protector.",2
"I wish I could take a photo of my own phone to show you what I'm talking about, but I can't right now. I have put on a million different brands of glass screen protectors before and know how to do it perfectly. These ones, however, suck. I put it on exactly how i was supposed to and still along the edges I have lots of little spaces where the protector isn't sticking to the phone. Also, there are a few tiny little bubbles in random spots and cannot get them out. It's just not a good screen protector at all, usually a screen protector is a screen protector, but not this one. I thought I could get away with getting a cheap pack of 3 but was mistaken. Definitely won't buy these again.",2
"I’m pretty confident in saying we all have installed the screen protectors several times out of the year, installing it was super easy and no air bubbles but my issue is not covering the screen completely. There’s a significant gap in between the edge. The phone would happen to receive a hit the screen protector would not do its job and I have broken the screen protectors from the edge so with confidence I can say this will not protect you…. The protector for the camera lens came with a small crack.",2
"Can't speak to the quality of the screen protector itself, although I'd suspect it's fine and will do the job. Installation involves some effort, however. For one, there is no alignment tool (unlike other brands I've used) to ensure that you cover the screen appropriately so you're just sort of hoping you have it right (I eventually got it mostly there, but it is a little off center still). The second thing is the bubbles. You really have to play with the screen protector to get it to not end up with any bubbles -- it does not do this on its own. The installation video provided does not really address these problems.

Personally, I would've paid a bit more for a product which came with an alignment tool (doesn't even have to be super fancy, cardboard would've been totally fine).",2
"We’ve used these for all of our different Apple phone versions over the years, but the last ones I just got for my phone this time were no good. I had to use 2 to even get it on semi ok and they both have bubbles all over them in different areas. It isn’t air bubbles. There is nothing on the phone itself. There is junk actually on the screen protectors. When you take them and hold them up you can see flecks in them.",2
"I had to use all 3 pieces of glass to one installed on my iPhone. The first 2 did not have suffecient adhesive covering the entire glass. The first glass was missing adhesive on the upper left corner leaving about 20% of the glass loose. The second piece was missing about 30% on the lower right. I kept thinking it was my lack of skill until I checked the glass and they were definitely missing adhesive. This can easily happen if the machine operator does not monitor the machine level of adhesive and it is low. Fortunately the 3rd piece applied easily and covered the screen without bubbles. Next order I'll upgrade to a more expensive product as I always had good luck with them.",2
"I bought another screen protector and it worked well, not these.

You get three, but I used all three before I found a workable solution. I followed the instructions, but the packets you are supposed to clean, and wipe the phones before you put the protector on, we’re dried out. There was no moisture, basically useless. I used one of my eyeglass cloths and got as dust free as I could. I then used the liquid lens cleaner for computer screens and TVs

Following the instructions, I pulled the film off the protector and it first one fit nicely on my phone. I can’t quite describe it, but it looked like there were bubbles under the film, and I was unable to use the area of the phone, that was under the ‘bubble “

I thought I must have not dried the phone off well enough, and pulled the first one off . The second was a repeat of the first try. There were still bubbles I was very careful with the last one. I did get rid of most of bubbles, but I’ve kept it on because I can’t risk having my expensive phone screen broken.

I don’t notice it now, just when I have my Home Screen on.

I would not buy this brand get another",2
"A friend of mine bought these because the product is highly rated, but then went through all three screen protectors in a week. She bought an Otterbox screen protector a few months ago and hasn't broken one since.

When I put this on my phone, I had a bubble and used a credit card to try and remove it, as most screen protectors tell you to do. However, as I tried to remove the bubble, my credit card scratched the screen protector. A screen protector should NOT be that easy to scratch; I've had it for a few days since and it hasn't scratched further, but I'm not sure how long it'll last. It's best to spend your money elsewhere.",2
"The Ailun lens protector does not fit the Iphone 15 Otterbox Defender case. Otherwise, Ailun makes great lenses. But that is not my main issue. Amazon is very good at return policies and so is the company Ailun. But, as stated in Amazon's return procedure, I took the product back to Staples in Morganton, NC to initiate the return. The lady behind the counter was sooooooo rude and disgruntle. This is not Amazon's fault or Ailun. As a compliment, I said, ""This is so convenient in returning a product. It is very efficient."" The employee at Staples fired back, ""I'm glad it is for you because my store makes nothing on these returns and it is a pain and hazzle for all of us working here to deal with this."" If there are cameras in the store this story can be verified. She took the small box the product come in, put a sticker on it, and then tossed it into a box. She then walked off. I will never go back to Staples again. So, ridiculously rude and unprofessional. I felt like I had been scolded for returning something.",2
"I ended up going thru all 3 screen savers at once, trying to get out the air bubbles. I did exactly what the directions said but every time I ended up with a bubble. They were small but I’m picky and I don’t want a single bubble - even a small one. So, it’s liquid glass for me I guess.",2
"these used to be my go-to screen protectors… they would last months before needing to be replaced. then within the past year something about the product must have changed. now i find that days after i replace the screen protector, the protector cracks. i’m not even dropping my phone so i don’t know how it’s doing this. at first i thought it might have just been a faulty pack, but it’s happened with several of the last packs i’ve ordered. i just replaced mine five days ago and today i noticed the corner has already cracked. i don’t understand how, because all my phone has done is sit in my pocket or on my nightstand. anyway, i’ll have to look elsewhere to see if i can find a screen protector that doesn’t immediately start to crack. very disappointed because i did love the convenience of these!",3
"I was really skeptical of these screen protectors because of the comments that mention having a ring around the screen -- which the company attempts to blame on apple. However, my first screen protector worked really well and had no bubbles or anything pop up while I had it on. I did get some cracks in the screen protector after only a couple months (but I somehow always get the same crack in my screen protectors). So I went for a second one (since it's a pack of three). But only a couple weeks after installing it, a bubble began to emerge at the top of my phone where the camera/speaker is. I have a hard time believing this is due to any warping of my phone considering that the first screen protector did not get any bubbles...",3
"I cannot address screen protection as I have not dropped my phone since applying the protector to my phone. However, the adherence of the protector to the screen is not the best. I was very careful with the cleaning of my screen and the technique of applying the protector to my screen but within two days the protector was pulling away from the screen in 2 places around the edges. In spite of applying pressure to these areas it continues to pull away. It is not bad enough to change out the protector but I’m glad there are 3 screen protectors in the package should it pull away enough that replacement is required.",3
"I usually get a different brand of screen protectors for my phone, but I got my iPhone quicker than expected and needed something fast so I ordered this on amazon. The material seems like solid quality. It is extremely hard and seems like it will last. I have had no issues with bubbles, or it lifting. I think this will work great on direct impacts if something hits your phone right in the middle, however, if you drop your phone and it hits the corner, I don't have confidence that it will save your phone. It is advertised as being edge to edge however this is NOT the case on the iPhone 15. There is about a half a cm gap on all sides. Because it's not edge to edge, it was really hard to install as I basically just floated it, in the middle to cover what I could. I give it 3 stars because it was cheap, solidly made and came fast.",3
"I ordered this tempered protective glass for my brand new iPhone 15 pro max, but it comes about 3/8 of an inch short of covering my entire screen, so I decided to try and find a better fit before applying it permanently to my new phone’s screen. The quality of the product seems great along with the packaging, but I need protective glass that’s going to protect my entire screen.",3
"Following the instructions to clean & dust-proof using enclosed wipes, I installed the protector on a completely flat surface. Though the process seemed smooth, three areas of non-adherence [lower left, lower right & center right] all left visible bubbles which no amount of rubbing will resolve. I’ll have to use a second glass to redo my phone protector, which is a down side to an otherwise durable, glare-free product. AARGH!",3
"I was a bit disappointed to be honest. I've used this brand many times for Iphones. The sides and screen crack so quickly as compared to just about anything else. I wouldn't buy this brand again for my iphone 14. Glare was good and fingerprint protection was really good. Also screen chips/shatters on the side and I've cut my finger from it more than once which hurts a lot!",3
"The screen protector is fine. However, this does not come with a frame that guides the screen protector onto the correct alignment. This means that I had to manually align the screen protector, which is difficult and slow (which becomes a problem if your room is dusty). The lack of a guide frame is not made clear anywhere in the product descriptions.",3
"Unless you know what you’re doing, it’s going to take several guesses to get things right. No instructions were included. My last case had a screen cover so I haven’t had to bother with a glass cover for 4 years.
The cover doesn’t go edge to edge on an iPhone 13.",3
"I've used a lot of screen protectors, and while these seemingly ""work"" they are probably one of the least durable ones. They seem to get cracks much more easily than other screen protectors I've used, so while cheaper, doesn't really do anything if I have to keep re-applying.",3
"I did the application just according to their videos, which was fairly simple and straightforward. However, there are very tiny, barely visible, air bubbles at the corner of the screen protector. They wouldn’t go away no matter what I do. Just to make sure I replaced the screen protector but the bubbles were there.",4
"I love my new screen. I honestly thought I would never say this, but it was very easy to install. I just removed my old screen protector, cleaned my phone screen and dried it, and lastly, placed the new screen protector on my phone slowly while applying pressure at the same time. Walla! It was done, and I am thrilled with the results.

I would recommend it to anyone! I must point out that it does not cover my front camera, so if that's what you're looking for, camera protection, this is not the product. On another side note, I ordered this delivery to come on the same day, but it came the next day; I paid extra, so don’t do same-day delivery. This is why I did not rate it 5 stars.",4
"These iPhone items were purchase because we couldn't use the extra ones purchased for our Samsung Galaxy phones. We are big fans of screen protectors. These have a few mm around the perimeter exposed, however, we use full cases which fill in the remaining space and adds additional impact layers between device and shock. Unfortunately modern iPhones no longer support fingerprint unlock, so we cannot attest to that function. Overall, worth the peace of mind.

Note: It would have been helpful if vendor included an alignment tool/guide to help center/compensate for the protector not completely covering the entire screen...thus the 1-star reduction.",4
"After using this screen protector for a couple months on my iPhone 15 Pro, it works great! It gives you everything you need to set up the screen protector without any dust particles or air bubbles in between. Plus, it gives you multiple screens if you happen to damage one.

The one negative thing about this is that it’s pretty difficult to set up if it’s your first time trying. I’d recommend using the tabs they give you to set it up easier, as well as not having anything on the phone, like a case. If you mess up, you can always just use a spare one that they give you.

Overall, great product to protect your phone from scratches and cracks.",4
"I took off my old screen cover and cleaned it thoroughly and I still ended up with a bubble of air/dust I couldn't get out. My old screen cover did not have any bubbles so maybe it was introduced from the cleaner pads? I dunno but my other phone cover went on and adhered much faster than this one. Can't complain too much though, it was inexpensive.",4
"Product seems to do everything it says it does however in the QR code instructional video it has a clear frame to help with installation, I did not get one because it is not mentioned in description or even 'usually bought with' and without it, it is much easier to get bubbles in the installation. Unfortunate it didn't just come with the package.",4
"I'll tell you Why! No instructions on installation in the box. Had to go online to find them. I've used other brands that include simple 1, 2, 3 instructions. In the end, all was well.",4
"I’ve used these for a while and though they crack fairly easily they do their job and protect my real screen. Outside of dropping it on something hard they’ve held up really well.",4
"This is a reliable screen protector, my issue is while it protects the screen it begins to show damage after a few months depending on how you use and carry your phone. The multi pack is the Best Buy as you’ll need to replace the protector as some point.",4
"I believe this product will protect the face of my iPhone 15. However the length and width of the product are both short of the length and width of the iPhone.",4
"This is very easy to install and it works well. I drop my phone fairly often, so I have a strong case and this protector on it. When I dropped my phone on asphalt, one time, the screen protector cracked, but my phone was totally fine. So I bought this exact same product again, and once again, it was super easy to install. Really grateful to have had this on my phone.",5
"This is a fantastic set for the price. I paid $40 for some supposed specialty screen protector from the Apple Store and said protector
ended up cracking, peeling, gathering dirt, it was horrible. This packet comes with THREE protectors, excellent instructions and all the tools and gadgets you need to get the screen nice and clean in prep for adding the protector. Even if each protector only last me a month it still would cost me less to buy 4 of these (12 total since each pack has 3) and replace the protector each month than it costs me to buy that one at the Apple Store.",5
"This screen protector does its job. I bought this screen protector a little over a year ago. The screen protector comes with 3 protectors which I thought I didn’t need but it really came in handy. The first screen protector I put on my phone ended up breaking for some reason that I can’t recall and then the second one broke as well. I am on my last screen protector of the pack. These screen protectors aren’t super durable in my experience since I have never dropped my phone from any height over 1 foot (30 cm). However, I see these as essential for any iPhone 14 user. It is better to have the screen protector than to not have it. These screen protectors are also super easy to apply.",5
"These screen protectors are just perfect, exactly what i needed. Very good quality, arrived & functioned exactly as advertised, perfect fit for my Iphone 14 plus. I still cannot believe i got 3 for less than 10 bucks! The previous screen protector i had sucked. It was difficult to apply to my phone screen, pretty impossible to get it on without an air bubble or two stuck behind, got very cracked up & foggy in different areas within just 6 months or so, and was sold to me by the Verizon store (while purchasing my phone) for over $40 (for just 1 screen protector)!!!!! Which i am now pissed about! Needless to say, I’m extremely happy i found & bought these, which you just place on top of your screen & literally watch it self-attach like magic. I’m going to buy 2 more packs of 3 actually. I know if i do so, i can keep this phone for years and years without having to upgrade so often like most people sheepishly do, and that’s a really good feeling for me. Very very satisfied!",5
"My son cracked his phone on his way home from school so I desperately needed to replace it before the actual screen got damaged. This is the second time purchasing these screen protectors and I can honestly say that they have done the job in keeping the screen safe from shattering. The price is great for a set of 3. You get to have extras in case another fall happens which is a huge plus. Shipping was so fast, I was able to get it the following day after ordering. I really recommend these protectors if you’re looking for something that will keep your screen from cracking. Sturdy and easy to install. Can’t beat this price!",5
"My phone popped out my pocket just now when I was playing basketball with my son, landing face down. I saw three points on the screen that lead out to spider web cracks. I took my phone under good light for a close examination after coming home. AND I peeled off the screen protector and was so relieved to find it was the protector that cracked, my phone screen is intact. Immediately came to Amazon to buy another case of the protector. Quality approved!",5
"I like that there are 3 of them. Super easy to put on. Perfect fit. I’ve dropped my phone several times now and the screen protector isn’t even damaged. When installing, just take your time and make sure above all else, your screen is dust free and perfectly clean. Sit at a sturdy desk or table with good lighting and just take your time and you will achieve perfection and complete protection!",5
"I have purchased a number of these glass covers for my phones over the years. They work like One would expect and protect the glass casing on your phone. over the years, I have dropped my phone a number of times, and while the protective glass may crack or shatter the glass on the phone remains perfectly intact. They provide an inexpensive safeguard to a more expensive accident if you drop your phone. just follow the directions and the protective glass goes on your phone and quickly without any bubbles underneath. Removal and replacement is also very simple.",5
"I’ve had three different iPhones now and this is my go-to screen protector. Comes with a wet wipe, dry wipe, dust sticker, and guide stickers for each protector. The protector goes on cleanly with little pressure. Be aware that it does come with three protectors. I put this specific protector on an iPhone 13 Pro with a Spigen case. You can hardly tell it is there. The feel is just like ordinary glass and the touchscreen is still highly responsive. My iPhone is undamaged thanks to the previous screen protector of this brand that took the brunt of a fall onto asphalt.",5
"Never have an issue with this protector. Ever since I bought my Pro Max this is the only protector I buy. I never have an issue with this product. It has only cracked on me twice because I dropped my phone while getting out of the car and then again on the bathroom. No damaged to my phone just the protector. Never have an issue with applying it to my phone. As long as you take your time and even it out as much as you can it’s no problem.",5
"This is by far the worst screen protector that I have ever purchased. The shoddy quality brings this product to a sub-grade level of effectiveness. While working on installing the screen protector it accidentally fell off my desk and shattered when it hit the floor. (See pic) The screen protector is ultra slim and flimsy and I would suspect that it would shatter if you have your phone in your back pocket and sat down. The other issue is the fingerprint circle, which is clearer than the screen protector, has an adhesive on it so when you apply it on your phone you can see the glue within the circle creating an unclean look to your phone. I tried removing the glue but was unsuccessful, this was my first attempt which I had to discard. My second attempt is when it fell off my desk. All in all, extremely dissatisfied with this product. I will not recommend this to anyone.",1
"Because of the decent reviews, I purchased the screen protector. Unfortunately, my experience does not reflect the positive reviews of others. I received my pack of three, and begin to try to install it on my phone. However, the mold that they gave me to align screen protector was slightly smaller than the protectors. That created a hassle putting the protector on the phone as it impeded the process. Protectors always went on at a funny angle and left massive air bubbles. I’ve never had this issue with any other protectors previously, so I decided to go onto their website and watch the instructional video which was help on the third try, I finally was able to get one on without bubbles. Still doesn’t fit the screen well, but it works.

I know this is a longer review already, but I did want to mention that I reached out to the company which sells this product, and they were very little help. They wanted me to go through a bunch of rigmarole in order to help me I wasn’t going to do that for the equivalent of six dollars",1
"I get more disappointed every day!!! I’ve only used TechArmor on my iPhones, but theirs have started receiving terrible reviews of late for being too fragile. I feel like these are also too fragile. They were over 4 star rated when I bought them & why I figured I’d give them a try…… but have broken two in a matter of 6 weeks and they both broke within 2 weeks of having put them on. Whoever has given them 4-5 star ratings may have had much better luck with than I have mine. Which is a Bummer. I’d hoped these would be a great replacement for the TA., but both seem to be entirely too fragile now. Didn’t want to try the more expensive brands, but in the interest of protecting my iPhone screen I’m gonna have to bite the bullet. One star all day long because they crack right at the bottom edge immediately. I am keeping the third as an emergency spare, but bought the Spigen to try moving forward and only get two for $17. Hopefully they’ll be much less fragile.",1
"Well so I bought two packs on December 13 to give me 6 protections so that I could keep my iphone 15 pro Max protected and well yes it does what it is supposed to but durability is exactly 1 hit for each i have gone now through 4 of the screen protectors and 2 of the camera protectors so far so yes my phone is mint condition but I have never had this kind of protection that would secure the phone for one odd drop then need to replace because it is broken, am I glad my phone is ok YES, would I buy this product again? Unfortunately no, considering I have only 2 drops left of protection because I only have 2 more screen protectors to go I will start looking for something more durable",1
"Update: it’s been one week and all of the screen protectors have cracked!!! Waste of money. I’ve never dropped my phone or abused it… they clearly don’t take any impact of any kind.

The first one had relentless bubbles that kept developing.
The second one cracked while in my purse… never even dropped my phone!
Now I’m on the third one and I’ve had my new phone for 3 days. The package claims to have a warranty but the customer support form spins and spins on the website, so I can’t even file a warranty claim.",1
"The only reason I’m not returning this is because I already put the camera protector on but omg I opened the first screen… just a red sticker no perky screen came off. Okay so I tried seeing if maybe the red sticker wasn’t working and I had to manually peel it. Nope just a plain glass screen. Tried the next one. Same thing. I was really hoping the third one would be my lucky screen but nope!!! I already ordered a different brand of screen protectors and will just take my loss.",1
"Very disappointed as this screen protector cracked under normal usage in 3 months. I guess that’s why it comes in a 3 pack. I’m very careful with my phone and honestly, the crack just showed up one day. I have no idea what caused it. My husband installed the 2nd one a few weeks ago on his phone, so we’ll see how that one holds up. I just put the third one on after the first one cracked. It doesn’t install easily and with both screens, I’ve been unable to press out bubbles. They press out but reappear. I do not recommend this product. I was trying to not spend a lot of money, but when it comes to protecting your expensive iPhone, one shouldn’t be that frugal.",1
"Comes with 3 screen protectors. First one wouldn’t “set” onto glass. Second one had an indentation in the protector so it wouldn’t set on the glass around that area. Third one had to set and reset to get it on the glass just right. The guide it comes with is useless. It pulls on the protector when you want to take it off. I’m very particular about doing things correctly, but this was frustrating. The lens protectors you have to put in and take off to get a good fit.",1
"Installed the screen protector 2 days ago on my iPhone 15, no fall nor any events to be mentioned and a small crack was noticed on the top left side that within few hours moved diagonally down on the screen. This morning, went to install the second screen... while setting it on the phone, it cracked very artistically! Installed the 3rd screen; NOT holding my breath! Installed the last screen in the package! The new phone is about a week old and going through 3 screens is a record without a doubt, considering having had an IPhone 11 for many years- with only 2 screen protectors changeThrough all those years!
Extremely disappointing! Cheap material; should not be marketed!",1
"Giving 1 star because I like the application frame that comes with this which makes for an easy line up and protector goes on smoothly with no air bubbles. However, I had the protector on for less than a week before it cracked and I didn’t even drop my phone from any major heights. The highest it may have fallen during that time was from the arm of my couch onto the floor which is maybe 2 1/2 - 3ft. The reason I’m not giving it 0 stars is because it comes with extra so hopefully the others will hold up better and also because I used this brand for my son’s iPhone 14 Plus 3months ago and so far he hasn’t had any issues so maybe this one was just a fluke? His is the privacy screen type so it’s a little different. I’m just thankful my brand new phone didn’t damaged.

Update: apparently it’s not just a fluke. My 2nd screen has already cracked. I’ll be looking for another brand",1
"I’ve had this screen protector since the middle of December and it’s now the middle of February for context.
Full disclosure, I am not an overly graceful person. I drop my phone probably once, maybe twice a week, but never with any force or from above 3 feet.
The camera protector had a crack within the first week. It happened when I was sitting at a table and it fell on our vinyl flooring out of my pocket, so no more than 2 feet.
The screen wasn’t far behind. It formed very thin cracks across the screen from corner to corner after a month or so. The cracks appeared very minor so I wasn’t too concerned.
Then this morning, I woke up to do my daily routine with a casual doom scroll on my phone. I swiped from left to right and got a literal glass shard imbedded into my skin (a decent sized one too) from catching the edge of the screen protector with my finger. I turned the light on and the edge of the protector was hardly chipped away at all. There was no visible sign that the glass was ready to chip like that, especially that big of a piece, other than the small thin cracks up the middle of the screen.
So it’s been about 2 months with this screen protector and to be honest, I just don’t feel like I’m hard enough on my phone to consider this amount of damage reasonable. It’s much more brittle than anticipated.
Even though this product has not be kind to me, I give 2 stars based solely on the fact that my actual camera and phone screen is still intact.
Overall, I wouldn't buy again and can’t say I’d recommend it at all.",2
"I bought this specifically for the camera-lens protector (iPhone 15 Pro), so this review is just for that part of the product; I haven't tried the screen protectors, as I already had a very good one installed. I watched all the instruction and support tutorial videos, read the reviews, etc. so ""due diligence done"" prior to usage.

Anyway, although the seller is great, the product (again, just the camera-lens protector) not so much, at least for me.
1) Doesn't work well with Otterbox Defender XT case for iPhone 15 Pro - EXTREMELY tight fit and after 30 mins of massaging and rubbing and tucking as best I could, it was still only 99%, which I would have tried to live with were it not for:
2) Immediate and permanent ""White Halo Effect"" - they even include blurb sheet about this in the box, supposedly one out of every 10,000 iPhones, etc,. Well, I've never been just that lucky (or unlucky) one out of 10,00 in anything, so I believe this is a defect in the product itself - I may be mistaken about that, but after trying to make it adhere correctly, it went back to ""white halo"" every time. The final kicker was:
3) When I started to remove the case after an hour to try to either make the installed one work or try one of the other 2 left in the box, the lens protector popped right off/out as if it had never even adhered at all.

So, this is a classic case of ""You get what you pay for,"" in the end. I'm sure the seller will respond with all kinds of ""tech-support"" and show me everything I did wrong, but I've been around that may-pole far too many times in life to even bother, especially over a $9 Amazon product (my time is worth ever-so-much-more than that). I'll keep the screen protectors for installation should my current one ever break or need replacement otherwise. Couldn't take any pictures to include with this, as my phone is my camera (shrug).",2
"Putting one of these on my phone went pretty much how every other modern-day screen protector is applied - just get allll the dust off first and it's straightforward. The few trapped air bubbles went away after a day or two, as expected.

I've had these for two months and so far I've had two of them shatter, both of them right at the edge of the protector. I don't abuse my phone - it's in a protective case and I don't throw it around or drop it. But it's in my pocket next to a small set of keys, so I'm going to attribute these cracks to having these keys next to the phone. I've been using screen protectors like this one for years and years, and I've only ever had one crack on me prior to this. Because of this, I'm going to try a different brand next time.",2
"I was suspicious of this because of how cheap this was. I was right to be suspicious. I can’t get the screen on without any bubbles happening. I thought maybe the screen was janky or was wearing out from my repeated attempts to apply it so I threw that one out but the second screen I used had similar issues. It’s fine if you’re clumsy and need an emergency screen protector but it does not adhere automatically. Also the frame used to aid the screen wasn’t the best and may have been the reason I was getting bubbles. It didn’t fit quite snug and I would actually have to watch the edges and missed them a few times. Also sometimes when I removed the frame it would pull up the screen. So I guess I’ll have bubbles for now until I can get a better screen protector.",2
"Item comes in a pack of 3 including camera lens protectors. I’m not too sure about the quality of it but it’s not even a 2 months since I got it and the screen cracked (second picture) while it’s in my shoulder bag with my keys, yeah most likely my keys cracked the screen but I’m like, “how?” I don’t throw my bag or anything.

Also I just saw that 1 of the 3 arrived already cracked? (First pic, still has ‘peel off’ tag so I haven’t used it) It’s already too late to return bcuz I only saw it recently when changing out the cracked screen. I’m down to the last one and I’m just hoping it’ll last for some time.

The cover for the camera lens is holding up really well…so far.",2
"I have installed hundreds of screen protectors in my day and when I upgraded to my iPhone 15 Pro, I purchased this ahead of time so I had it when my phone arrived. The installation video was nice, however, 2 of the 3 alcohol wipes were dry upon opening them. The adhesion of the first screen didn't work well at all despite a brand new and cleaned screen. So I tried screen 2 after another screen cleaning/prep with the same alcohol wipe as I didn't have the others. Was better but not great. Tried third and same issue. Boxed them up and sending it back. Need better QC procedures.",2
"I’ve used my fair share of tempered glass screen protectors. These are not the best. The first one I applied had massive bubbles that would not come out no matter how hard I tried to press them out. It was almost like the screen protector itself wasn’t flat. So the first one was junk. Second one, nearly the same problem. It still has two minor bubbles that would not come out. Frustrating, but fine I guess. Still yet to use the third one but I’m expecting the same problem. Also, the edges of the screen protector are sharp and not rounded like on other protectors. And finally, those little camera protectors are junk. Always fall off after a week and sometimes make pictures blurry or have lens flares when taking pics outside. I would keep looking for other protectors even though these ones have good reviews.",2
"It's cheap so the quality is also the worst I have ever used. If you drop your phone every now and then, maybe this is a good option for you because you want a cheap one so you can change it every week without worrying about the price.
But the durability of this product is at most 1 month. It has poor scratch resistance and fingerprint resistence. It will automatically crack under normal usage. And the plastic can peeled off after several days of usages.
The protector does not cover the full screen. It leaves an edge and it’s hard for you to align it. So it's also hard for installation.
If you want something easy to install and last longer like 1 year, buy those around $20. This is cheapest so I guess you can not expect more from it.",2
"Two of the protectors came with flaws on them. One has an imprint of something like a card on it and a sticky material and the other one has a scratch on the corner. I only have on of three that is actually good. I did just like the video said.
Installation was easy but I cannot use two of them. So disappointed. I emailed their support to see if they actually stand behind their product as they say inside the packaging.",2
"Good and easy installment but I think they make it cheaply on purpose in order for it to crack easily and for you to buy more. Just having this on my phone and dropping once, it was so easy for it to chip and crack. I replaced the screen protector with another one that came with it and 2 days later, just having it in my back pocket, it cracked again. If you don’t mind the chips and cracks on the glass then this will be fine with you, but I like a crack-free screen protector glass and I’m tired of changing it out just from minor drops or brushes against things. I’m definitely trying out other companies’ products to find a screen protector glass that’s more durable.",2
"the “easy open” tab on the box is NOT an easy open, I also damaged my top screen protector (along with other reviewers) but I ordered the 3 pack so not a huge deal, just annoying.
the screen protector is great, but the camera protector sucks. it’s so bulky, hardly stays stuck and doesn’t fit within the “window” of my otterbox case. the case won’t close around it whatsoever, when i try to open it back up to try and move the protector it just sticks to the case and i have no choice but to pop it out which results in me getting fingerprints on the sticky part, ruining the cover. I used all 3 camera protectors trying to get it to work and they just wouldn’t. For such a highly recommended product it seems silly to me that it wouldn’t work with an otterbox (one of the most used cases for iphones). I’ve now ordered a different camera protector that actually works. I know the price is cheap so it’s not necessarily worth the complaint, I just want others to know as I had ordered this before my new phone came in and was left feeling unprotected while I had to order a different product to actually cover the lenses.",3
"I've installed dozens of these screen protectors over the years. While my personal ones tend to last the life of the phone, my family members often measure the life of these protectors in weeks. I say this because I am very familiar with how to install these and do it well, usually with absolutely no bubbles or debris under the glass. This brand is my go-to and I've used it before to great effect. These ones for the 15 Pro Max seem different though somehow. Peeling off the back seems to super charge these with static which draws dust and debris from all over. I watched a piece of hair/fuzz I didn't even see lift off my shirt and rush towards the freshly peeled backside. This is an immediate loss, because once it hits the sticky back there is no removing it without ruining the entire thing. I went through the entire 3 pack without an acceptable result ( . I'll likely order again and give it another go, but unsure if I'll end up with differing results. The room I do this in is no more dusty than it was last week when I replaced one of these on another phone, and yet today it seems like I need to do it in an industrial clean room in order to get good results. I'll again point out, the dust isnt landing on the glass and being pressed under, its being attracted to the backside of the glass as soon as the film is removed.

I'm also unsure about the camera lens protectors. These were a bonus. but I really like the idea given how protruding they are on this phone. But after installation, I'm seeing reflection/streak/lens flare that were not present prior. They disappear immediately when its removed, so it's very much a result of the cover. This was noticed during post-testing so will need to try some optimal picture taking to see if it interferes then.

For now, this is a three star product in my view, as its functionality is there (will protect the screen) but some of the issues are interfering with the usability/aesthetics.",3
"Purchased this for my new phone along with for one of my family members phones. Within a week the screen protector got chipped and it developed a crack over the top part of my phone. My phone is protected, but the crack in the protector is annoying. About a week after that the camera protector cracked on one of our phones. We switched it out and about a few weeks later the new camera protector had some cracks on it. I checked my camera protector, and sure enough, there was a chip on the edge. So all 3 camera protectors and one of the front screen protectors were showing signs of damage within two months. We haven’t been abnormally rough on our phones, so I’m thinking these protectors are brittle. I guess they have protected our phones in that we don’t have and damage on them, but it doesn’t seem like it takes much for them to crack or chip. One chunk of glass came out and hurt my family member, so take off the camera protectors if they ever get cracked.",3
"I’m a returning customer of this product. I’ve been using these screen protectors for over 5 years. I have had to buy them 3 or 4 times, and since they come in a two-pack, I’ve used at least 6 in the last 5 years. I like this specific product because it comes in a two-pack and of the lense protector, and wipes that come in the package. I haven’t had any complaints until this time, the day after I put on the screen, it cracked. I don’t even remember dropping my phone or doing anything unusual that would crack my screen protector, so I was very surprised. Nevertheless the screen protector has always protected my screen, I haven’t had a cracked screen in years because of this product.",3
"lo compre el de 3 protectores ( incluye le de la camara que No instale , porque seguro baja la calidad de la camara, no lo se ,lo supongo ) es una marca reconocida, es muy facil de instalar , vi previamente los videos de la empresa , hice tal cual lo indican y vi como el liquido iba desplazándosela, hasta que termino dejando en la parte baja a la derecha 4 globos, intente sacarlos y pude con 2 , pero quedaron 2 que no puedo sacarlos , deberia traer como otros alguna PALETA quizas con ello saldrían , la verdad saqueando el que tenia porque aparecieron globos y puse este y a pesar de tenes menos tiene y NO se los puedo sacar.",3
"These were super easy to install on my phone, I've used this brand before with my other iphones and they were fine. But this time around I'm noticing that finger prints show up super easily and are VERY hard to remove. I wipe my phone a ton during the day with tissue, blankets, my sleeve, etc and it just smears around the oils. I try not to touch my phone right after putting lotion on but it doesn't seem to matter. I wipe it clean with eye glasses cleaner and it's smudged the second i touch it again. otherwise they work for helping not get cracks or scratches on your phone.",3
"These screen protectors work. The downside is the chip or crack quite easily. One cracked on me while my phone was in my pocket with my car keys. Another screen protector came with a flaw on the screen that wasn’t visible until I put it on the phone. The screen protector did great when my fell down some rough stairs. I had to replace the protector but it saved the phone screen.
Each screen protector costs around $2 so it pretty cheap to replace",3
"I had something similar to these before and they were great, but this brand hasn’t been the best. It took me two screen protectors before it would go on without bubbles or issues. My previous kind I had I didn’t have this issue. I also followed the instructions exactly as they were written. There was only one protector for the camera lenses and that broke within 2 months of being on my phone. I’m not that impressed with these to be honest.",3
"The main screen protecter went on flawlessly and does a great job. The phone fits so accurately in the guide provided and protector sits in just the right position to look perfect. No bubbles! HOWEVER, the camera lens cover is too large for my apple case so it's just getting trashed. It prevents the case from fully covering the corners of the phone, thereby useless. This design flaw needs a little work...",3
"The camera protector is great, it doesn’t interfere with quality (that I’ve noticed at least) and there’s no added glare. The screen protector itself though is kinda bad, it cracked very easy and even though I am to blame for dropping it so much, the one I had on my previous phone didn’t even crack until around the 2 year mark and I had the phone for 3. This one cracked probably within a month though.",3
"I rarely drop my phone, so I use these pretty much as insurance for when I inevitably drop it knowing that the screen protector is gonna take all of the punishment. I dropped my phone face first into a dry sink, and the top of the protector shattered. I've had my phone for months now and at least the protector never scratched, lifted, or held bubbles! It'll just save your life one time lol. If you're trying to get a protector that will save you from multiple drops, I don't think you can find any cheap Amazon tempered glass protector that will go unscathed for each one. Installation was super easy and you won't have to fight any lingering bubbles if you follow the instructions and use the things they give you.",4
"The screen protector for I-phone 15 fits well and easy to install with included template. Template is not symmetrical therefore make sure you have top orientated correctly. The camera lens covers did not fit correctly with the otterbox commuter phone case with out filling with fine grit sandpaper. I am no longer using the lends covers as I preferred a different model via Amazon with the 3 individual lens covers. They were much less bulky and fits w/ otterbox commuter case.",4
"Good price and this includes 3 sets of screen and 3 lens protectors. Includes the usual alcohol swab and patch of cloth, but a nice touch was the included sticky-pads to get the last pieces of lint or dust off your screen. The installation frame helps you to center the screen protectors perfectly. Camera lens protectors are a nice addition...a little bit of force is required but it snaps right on and does not interfere with the fitment of my iPhone's Caseology case. I would recommend this kit to my family and friends.",4
"If you do not expect a perfect fit on the glass (all four sides are lacking to some degree - which does attract crumbs/dust/dirt, too), this is a magical product! Install was a breeze, especially if you have used those films in the past (ugh!). But, the smaller fit on my glass face was a disappointing.",4
"My initial review was 5 stars, but it have now used all 3 covers bc any time you drop your phone, this protects the phone but breaks the screen protector.

It’s still a quality kit and good item, but I’m off to shop for one a little more durable itself.",4
"Great quality product after installed correctly. The alignment tool is helpful in getting the alignment correct. After cleaning with the alcohol wipe and drying with the microfiber cloth using the sticker to remove any dust is crucial. The included stickers work, but are small. Just make sure to go over multiple times to ensure no dust is on phone screen. If you have pets try to turn off fans or anything that could stir up any hair into the air and fall on the screen while placing screen protector. Once screen is clean and you place the screen protector on and run you finger along one end you will watch as most of the air runs out the other end. If any hair or dust is on the screen you will know at this point. If something is under the screen best of luck saving that screen protector. I’m convinced this is why they come with multiple in a package. The camera protectors again seem to be a quality product after installed correctly. They fit perfectly with an Apple branded clear case.",4
"I’ve used this brand multiple times before, and I like the value versus the competition.
However, this time they have changed their packaging and I busting two of the three protectors right out of the box because the perforations are horrible. That’s not easy that’s a recipe for breakage.",4
"So far it works well. The camera lense protector is nice since the lense fits inside and it doesn’t add much bulk to the lense. The screen protector is easy to install. The screen alignment piece is cheaply made and seems to be an after thought but it ultimately allows you to align the screen protector properly.",4
"It's good they give you three Screen Protectors as the first just did not seem to go on correctly.

Prepping the screen on my new out of the box iPhone 15 ProMax and using then Template it just did not lay correctly. I done this many times before. I gently lift it back up with my fingernail. I repositioned it.
When done I noticed an air bubble and something foreign in the middle ??. I use an eyeglass wipe under a credit card to keep it flowing over the glass to push bubbles to the edge. Didn't work. Where I lifted it with my nail caused the adhesive to bunch and could not be smooth out either.

I took it off and replace it with the second one. The second out went on flawlessly.

I saw reviews stating the Camera Lens protector didn't fit their case??? The back of the phone case needs a cut out. First place the protector through the case to see if it fits before installation! I put the back of my case on the phone and used it as a template for the camera lens protector and it fit perfect!

The verdict is it's a good ecomoncal screen protector. The mall charges $65 just for the screen.plus $35 for the camera. After a week it has held up well. Buy it works.",4
"Does what it’s supposed to do at a much lower price than competitors. I’ve had multiple ones on various phones. Some have cracked / shattered but always protected the phone itself. The Only negative is that the alcohol wipes included are ALWAYS dried out 😄",4
"I have bought this brand for my iPhones. The company I bought my new phone from wanted a ridiculously high price for the screen protector and installed. I’m not cheap but don’t want to pay stupid prices. Since I’ve had excellent results with this brand I bought it for the iPhone 15. I like it comes with 3 in the pack. I only used 1 screen protector for the previous phone. I dropped the phone a few times and the protector held up good. I didn’t need the other 2. But you never know if you will so I bought the three pack. And the price is very affordable and well worth it. It is so easy to use that I can do it. I’m clumsy and don’t have much patience with stuff. If I can do it - pretty much any one can. It has the guide to put the protector on, cloth to clean, wipes to wipe and dry before putting the protector on. Does not hinder sensitivity for touching the screen and easy to wipe fingerprints off. Does not get scratched easily. I put my phone in my front pocket a lot.",5
"So easy to install. The included bracket is so helpful and is making this package worth every penny.

The camera protectors are very elegant and easy to install. The only small issue with them, no matter what you do, there will remain a few small air bubbles. But they never affect the camera.

Another advice, if you install it on a brand new iPhone:
- The first moment you open the iPhone brand new box, install the camera protector while the phone is still face-down in the box
- flip the phone around, get the screen protector ready and handy, get the dust removal sticky take (also included) handy and ready to remove any last-minute dust, hair, lint, dandruff flakes...etc.
- Remove the iPhone paper screen protection, and immediately place the bracket on (pay attention to the part that says ""Top"" on the install bracket
- Carefully install the screen
- Give it about 10 minutes and make sure during that time to squeeze any air bubbles out
- Lastly, install the case (if you plan on using one)

You are now good!",5
"I've put on tempered glass screen protectors on multiple phones over the years, but this was by far the easiest and best install yet. The results are perfect after following the included directions and the screen is responsive with the protector on it. I'm very happy with this purchase and thrilled there are three protectors in the box. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this product again or recommend it to others.

My Install Experience:

My iPhone 15 had just been unboxed and I'd peeled off the protective screen cover. I had laid out all the things I needed for the screen protector install: alcohol wipe, dry wipe, lint removal sticker, and the screen, and washed my hands before starting. First, I cleaned the screen with the alcohol pad. Second, I wiped it dry. Third, I went from left to right in small increments to remove any dust with the included sticker. I had read the included directions before doing these things and then placed the included guide on the screen without touching the screen when I did it. I think this red frame guide makes a huge difference!

Carefully peeling back the bottom corner of the protector's covering I placed the bottom edge (you could do the top) and peeled back the rest of the sticky backing, carefully lowering the protector onto the screen within the red guide. No adjustment was needed. It fit perfectly and all I had to do was lightly move my finger horizontally back and forth over the protector to adhere it to the screen. At an angle, I could actually see where I'd pressed it down, and in doing so I could see the cover sticking without any dust or bubbles.

The results for this install were perfect the first time, and I notice no issues using the screen on the iPhone 15. I'm very happy with it and it works with my CaseMate case, and I expect it will also work with my Otterbox branded one.

The package ships with covers for the camera as well, but no directions on how to put it on. I think it's just a snap-in-place thing, but I'll have to play around with it to see if it works with my cases. I'm not sure I'll use it as I've never had one on the camera and had cases that provide enough protection.

Overall, a great protector that goes on like you'd expect it to to protect your iPhone screen. Buy it!",5
"looooove this protection kit!! It's not a stupidity protection, but it definitely offers protection for your iPhone! :P So let me explain what happened in my case and why I got into such conclusion :D (little long, but please bare with me):

1. Extremely easy box opening!! I just cut the edges where the foil wrap circles were placed and… voila’s box unopened right away!! (check my pics) - not sure why other buyers had any trouble with that!
2. I’ve read the instruction and watched the videos on the Ailun Youtube page, and placed my iPhone 15 in the included in the package frame, but… for some reason I misunderstood the video and did it in the opposite way:, so I put the frame upside-down and put my iPhone there :D LOL :D That’s not the way they showed and wrote the manual!! But I'm a blondie after all :P
3. After that I unwrapped one of the screens protectors and placed on my phone screen aligning to the top and since I did it wrong in the first time it left too much space at the bottom - it didn’t look bad, but I felt I did something wrong :P
4. I tried to take that screen protector off and place it in the right spot, finally following the instructions correctly, but it got too many dust (like little things, micro dust, so I decided to toss it away and start over with another new screen protector available in the package (glad there are 3 of them :) - blondie proof protection) :D
5. I cleaned my iPhone screen following the instructions (using wet and dry cloth for cleaning - awesome kit) and applied the new screen protector (2nd one from 3 available in the package) and all went amazing with the case finally used properly!!

No issues except those couple bubbles (literally couple micro ones) I couldn’t get rid of! I thought I’m gonna give up as I tried all direction to fix this issue and it didn't work as I was doing it too fast - they were gone in a seconds but then came back until…. I realized - please ready it if you have similar problem - until I very slowly pressed the screen when the bubble(s) was/were and slowly moved around!! After few times of doing it (while before the bubbles were coming back) they finally disappeared leaving my screen clear!! Phew!!

I truly hoped all this efforts were worth to keep my screen safe and I here is my proof of that!! What else you can do with the wasted screen protector you were unable to place right at the firs time :P - I tested it!! I broke it and guess what, even broken it stayed in one piece!!!! (check my pics again!!). How cool is that??!! Can you imagine your iPhone screen getting a damage having this screen protector?? Now I completely understand all other ppl reviews saying it saved their device(s)!!

Hats off Ailun!! Not only for providing such affordable and efficient products, but also for making sure (or at least trying) that everyone understand how they works even for such silly customers as I am!!",5
"Headline: """"

I recently purchased the Ailun 3 Pack Screen Protector for iPhone 15, and I couldn't be more impressed. The package not only includes top-notch screen protectors but also comes with a bonus – 3 Camera Lens Protectors and an Installation Frame. The installation process was a breeze, thanks to the thoughtful design. The screen protector fits flawlessly, providing crystal-clear clarity and ensuring my iPhone 15's display stays pristine. The camera lens protectors add an extra layer of security, enhancing the overall protection. Ailun has truly exceeded my expectations, delivering a comprehensive solution for safeguarding my iPhone 15. Highly recommended!",5
"I unknowingly dropped my phone in the hill country while working outside and stepped on it. The screen was star cracked from the rocks in three separate places, and on the camera cover on the backside. I got in the house removed the camera cover and screen cover and wiped the phone down. NO DAMAGE to phone at all. I was very pleased with this product and immediately installed a new screen and camera cover. Highly Recommended!",5
"The first day I applied there were still a couple bubbles on the screen protector even after pressing down, however, by the next day all the adhesive qualities worked and now no bubbles….just had to be patient. The cover for the camera lenses worked great and very easy to attach with no issue. This screen protector is definitely an improvement over other protective screens I have tried in the past on other phones. Very clear to see through and no effect on the capability on touch to access apps and features of phone. The kit comes with all the supplies you need for three different applications to share or use again on your phone. The kit contains everything you to clean phone prior to installation and to set the screen protector. The only issue I had was the blue frame that came with the kit to help set screen protector. Maybe I just did not understand but found the blue frame clumsy and awkward so I did not use. I certainly recommend this kit and you can’t beat the price for all the parts and pieces included should you need to remove and install another screen protector. Obviously, I don’t know the end result of the protection if phone dropped and hope not to, but at least it is some insurance to prevent damage to original screen.",5
"This review speaks only to (a) the installation process, and (b) my first impressions of how well the Ailun screen protector works with the touch screen.

(a) Others have complained that the Ailun packaging is hard to break into, but I just patiently and carefully used the tip of a knife gently to score the perforations on the package, which then opened up easily. My kit came with three protectors for the rear-facing camera, and I snapped one in place quite easily and it fits like a glove. Now for the hard part, which is the rectangular screen protector. Three of these came in my kit, also three alcohol prep pads, also three Ailun dust absorbers, also one silky cloth, also a frame to insert on the iphone 15 Plus. With one of the alcohol prep pads, I gently cleaned the surface of the phone's screen. After 30 seconds, I gently rubbed over the screen (which was already dry) with the silky cloth. There did remain several specks of dust on the screen surface, so I applied one of the Ailun dust absorbers to that area of the screen, and it did pick up the dust (the dust absorber has a sticky side that picks up dust). Then I installed the blue frame onto the front of the iphone. Then I slowly and carefully lowered one of the screen protectors into the frame. But somehow I messed this up just a tad, and the screen protector was slightly ascue on the screen. So I gently peeled off the mis-installed screen protector and broke out another screen protector. The second installation try went perfectly with the protector fitting perfectly on the screen.

(b) It seems that the iphone touch screen is just as sensitive with the screen protector installed as it was without the screen protector.

All the individual parts of the kit I received were very nicely packaged.

Since the Ailun is about the least expensive screen protector I could find, I have no idea whether it will hold up as well as the more expensive brands. Very likely not. But, I do not intend to use the phone in apocalyptic conditions, so I should be okay.",5
"Let me share with you the tale of a girl who, upon acquiring her new iPhone 15 Pro Max, made a solemn vow to handle it with utmost care. So resolute was she in her decision that she eschewed the idea of getting a glass screen cover. Alas, this tale takes a turn for the worse, as you might have guessed. To spare you the mundane details, let’s just say it didn’t end well. Thankfully, salvation came in the form of these screen covers.

What initially drew me to these screen covers was their promise of clarity. And let me tell you, they did not disappoint. The glass is so clear that once applied, it’s virtually invisible. It’s like having an extra layer of protection without sacrificing the beauty of your phone’s display.

Now, let’s talk about the application process. I’ve had my fair share of struggles with screen protectors in the past – air bubbles, misalignment, you name it. But applying these covers was a breeze. They came with a really cool applicator tool that made the whole process smooth and hassle-free. Within minutes, my screen was flawlessly covered, with no pesky air bubbles in sight.

In conclusion, if you’re in the market for screen protection that’s both effective and unobtrusive, look no further. These screen covers offer unparalleled clarity and ease of application. Don’t make the same mistake I did – protect your phone from day one. Trust me, you’ll thank yourself later.",5
"When I bought my precious pocket super computer which holds our entire lives worth of memories (photos), financial apps, all contacts and means of communication and daily doses of entertainment, I wanted to protect it as best as possible. So I bought a case and a high dollar screen protector that comes one to the pack and costs around 35$. While it did last a bit, it ended up cracking me out of 35$. I searched for well reviewed screen protectors and came up with this brand. It comes with 3 to the pack, cleaning materials, and a case like alignment tool to evenly place the protector over the screen. While it MAY or may not be quite as durable as the 35$ one, it does it's job and you have three so they should last a while. Getting out of my car, I dropped my phone onto the asphalt and cracked this protector around the bottom. Praying my phone was okay when I got home I pulled it off and phone was good as new, so I popped the second one on and been going steady ever since. So my opinion, I'd rather have three of these for a fraction of the price of one expensive one. I recommend this over spending extra money for one that cracks just the same if dropped just right.",5
"I recently purchased this screen protector with the expectation of gaining privacy control for my device. However, upon using it, I discovered that it failed to deliver on its promised privacy features. The screen protector did not provide the level of privacy described in its product information.

Unfortunately, this product falls short of its advertised capabilities. Despite claiming to offer privacy control, it lacks the necessary features to effectively obscure on-screen content from prying eyes. This discrepancy between the product's description and its actual performance was disappointing and frustrating.

In addition to the privacy issue, I found that the screen protector did not meet the standards of quality I anticipated. The overall build and functionality did not align with what was promised, further adding to the disappointment.

Overall, I cannot recommend this screen protector to others seeking privacy control for their devices. It fails to deliver on its advertised features and does not meet expectations in terms of quality and performance.",1
"I made 2 purchases of this product at the same time. They break super easily and rarely last more than 2 weeks. I stopped using them and bought a new one, it was a bit more money but lasted 10 months with no damage. I had a couple of these left and put one in. On the second day I took my phone out of my jacket pocket and laid it in the side table. I had 2 US quarters in my other pocket and removed them and as I was putting them down one fell and hit the screen. It cracked the screen!!! A single quarter from about 2 inches fall. I remembered why I stopped using them. I’ve reached out, through Amazon, and they keep responding via email, that I need to send it to them through Amazon, which I have now done on 2 occasions. I am done with this product, it’s extremely poor quality and their complete lack of customer service.",1
"Brought this for my iPhone 15...within a week the camera protector cracked..I was terrified I just brought my phone in November, placed this screen protector on and a week later my camera screen was cracked..thankfully it was just the protector. I replaced it with another camera protector because it comes with 3..and that one cracked as well. None of the times was the phone dropped or hit. I hate this screen protector with a passion...it's too late to return and I dont feel like going through the hassle of getting my money back and I do not want a replacement I just want to warn people if you care about your iPhone 15 please DO NOT buy this screen protector!!! Almost had a heart attack twice thinking my screen cracked 😔😩😩😩 spend the few extra dollar to go with another protector trust it's worth not getting this cheap one!",1
"I ended up buying the wrong one prior and got this one after. I loved the concept of it, but after a few weeks I was noticing a headache and eyestrain. I wear glasses and that's prob what made it worse too. The privacy effect of the screen started to mess with my eyes and I had to take it off and get the regular glass ones. I really wanted to love this, but it wasn't for me. In terms of durability, it is great and it does the job. I've purchased other screen protectors from this brand and they last years. This just was the wrong choice for me.",1
"Update: durability is trash. Cracked after less than 24 hours and I have no idea how.

Can’t yet speak to durability. But it’s a good value and covers the screen. However it’s *significantly* reduced the quality of the screen. I will probably be taking this off after I find a replacement because the pixilation/ screen quality is so significant it looks like my phone screen image technology is from 10 years ago.
(I have an iPhone 15 pro max)",1
"I have always used this brand of screen protectors in the past, however, this time the screen protectors were shattered before I even got them on my phone. I cleaned and prepped my screen to place them on, opened one of the screen protectors and discovered that it was shattered even with the plastic film still on it. Two of the three screen protectors were shattered. And I can’t request a refund because I put the non-broken one on my phone already because I still need my phone to be protected and all of the options for a refund require you to send the broken product back. Super disappointed.",1
"Even fully tilted at an angle, you can see the screen. I've seen ones where you turn just a little bit and the entire phone looks like it's off. Not to mention how badly it sticks to the screen. I did a good job of putting the screen protector on, probably the most amount of time I spent putting one on, in the history of me putting protectors on. It just ends up loose",1
"Really! I’ve had other screen protectors for my old iPhone and never had a problem with it fitting the whole screen! This product not only doesn’t fit, it cracks easily with little force! I’m on the 3rd one and I’ve only had my new phone for a month and barely dropped it to cause the cracks! The bottom of my screen , there is light where it doesn’t fill it! And I know how to apply it! The top is matched but the bottom isn’t connecting! Waste of my money and will not be buying again!",1
"I am super disappointed. You can easily still see the screen from the side. It helps with glare and may make it slightly harder to peep but this is not fully private.
I use my device to access sensitive information such as medical records so I need to make sure it is private. I am buying another brand and sending this back. Waste of money if you need to protect your screen.",1
"I just bought these and put them on my phone two days ago. The cover for the cameras cracked instantly when I took it off the camera and it fell. Instant cracks everywhere and pieces falling off. Just now I set my phone down on an ipad and it hit the corner of the ipad. Next thing I saw cracks across the screen protector. Better the protector than my phone for sure but the materials are not durable. I would definitely not recommend. Additionally when typing, I had to hit the keys multiple times to text.",1
"I previously used this brand and it worked great. This time the screen protectors were a pain to put on. You have to manually align the screen yourself, so it's not the easiest to install. After that, there were several large bubbles after installing. They wouldn't go away even after using a spudger several times. Thinking it was me, I took off the protector and installed the other one. The sticker that you're supposed to use to peel off the plastic film just came off without lifting the protective film off, so I had to go to the third protector, which did the same. Took a bit of time to get the film off using my nails. After installing even more carefully this time, there were even more bubbles in a different spot, as seen in the photo. Going to order a new one elsewhere. The privacy functions works good, at least.",2
"I purchased the 14 pro max version and have to say, it works fine if you’re looking for privacy at a budget price. You have to ask yourself, how many times will you buy it? For me it was twice, and I don’t consider myself being hard on screen protectors, I replace a plain glass one from ESR only once in about a year. I installed the first on Dec25, since then it has cracked or chipped quite a few times. I used the first two in the box and then purchased a second package, when one of those chipped too I went with another brand. As I said before, they work great if you don’t mind replacing them. I also noticed that when looking at them they weren’t optically clear, you could see little “dots” which I assume is what causes the screen to go dark when viewed from the side. Installation wasn’t a problem because I used a frame from a different manufacturer to align the protector on my phone. I also purchased an iPhone 13 and iPhone Pro version and those don’t seem to have any problems, still on the first one with both.",2
"It doesn’t come with the installation aid that I am already used to. It covers only exactly the part of the screen, so you have to be super accurate, otherwise you’ll see the border of the screen in a different colour. But it wasn’t too terribly difficult to make it decent. However, once installed, I noticed to major problems that made me eventually remove it. First, the same technology that makes is not possible to see from the side also makes the resolution lower. IPhones have a great image, but it feels like a much older cheap phone with this on.
Even that wouldn’t be enough for me to take it off, because it is still protective, but I noticed twice in the same day that my phone was overheating too easily. It’s not a problem that my phone had before the screen protector. Since heat is the big enemy of battery life and could cause other problems, I decided to take off the screen protector. Now I’ll order a different one, because it’s too risky without a protector",2
"I like that this phone screen is tinted as I always have my work email pulled up on my phone. But, my phone screen was no longer CLEAR WHITE. With this tinted protector on, my white screen now has the tiniest lines in the screen which drives me absolutely crazy. If you don’t pay a lot of attention to detail this screen would probably work for you but after about 3 minutes I pulled it off due to the almost unnoticeable lines in the screen. Will repurchase the normal $50 tinted screen that I normally buy, that comes without the lines so my OCD doesn’t stress me out.",2
"The screen protector didn’t come with the alignment tool. I had to remove and reapply the screen multiple times to get it right. And even then, it’s not perfect.
Because of that, the screen is causing problems with my front camera. I have to angle my phone a certain way for Face ID to recognize me. When I take pictures or videos with the front camera, it comes out with a dark filter. At first, I couldn’t figure out why videos were coming out like they had a filter on, but then I realized it was the screen. This wouldn’t be such a problem if mine came with an alignment tool.
The screen protector does hold up well. I’ve dropped my phone face down multiple times aka only have 2 thin scratches. The screen is pixelated though, which was very noticeable when I put it on. The quality of everything goes down because of this screen which is so unfortunate.

At first I thought I could just deal with it, but it’s extremely annoying when I have to unlock things. Especially since I use Face ID for just about everything, so it’s time to go looking for a new one.",2
"The Screen protector itself seems to be of decent quality & installs fairly easily when you follow the cleaning instructions.
However once I installed it, My Face ID would not work, I even register an ""altered"" appearance & it would then only work at certain angles.
The Privacy screen seems to be adhered to the back of the glass protector & there is only a clear hole punch for the front camera, not the Face ID sensor & that hole is still covered with the clear glass of the screen protector. I believe the privacy screen is what is effecting the Face ID. Had they made the clear portion the size of the ""dynamic island"" I believe the face ID would function as it should & this would be a 5 start screen protector. I took it off & it works perfectly.",2
"Everything fit well. I thought it was perfect until I tried to re-apply my Otter box defender pro series case cover. It couldn't fit the lense protector in the Otter box iPhone 14 Defender Pro Case. Outside of that, the screen protector worked and fit as expected. It comes with a warranty/protection that explains that even if it applied incorrectly, they'd replace it which I though was a neat perk to the deal outside of the face that it come with 2 (in-case you have 1 phone and you just want to give it a second try). But, no matter how I tried to apply it, the lense protector was slightly too large to fit in the defender pro series otterbox which I used on my iPhone 12 (with a screen protector) and when removed to trade in was in brand new condition still.

So, the takeaway here is that if you get the Otter box defender pro series, the camera lense protection likely will not fit. -- If you find a way to make it fit yourself, I'd be happy to learn how you did it because the camera was the whole reason I upgraded as it was noticeably better than the iPhone 12 that I had previously.

Edit: I had air bubbles on both applications of the screen protector. I actually find that it makes the screen too dark for normal use anyways. I contacted the seller since the box comes with a warranty paper stating that ""even if improperly applied to the screen, they'd send a replacement."" Well, that was arguable the case even though the phone was brand new and i cleaned it thoroughly. The ai bubble in the corner bothered me (naturally). So I contacted them and told them, requesting a second shipment as it states they'd do. I haven't heard back from them.

So, make sure if you intend to get it, you like a dark screen. And don't rely on the warranty that they claim you can get a second if applied incorrectly or anything of that sort. No response to me makes me put the seller on my blacklist. At least have the courteously to respond and give a reason why they cannot hold up to the agreement that they've included in the product.",2
"I’ve bought many cheap screen protectors before. I decided to try out this privacy protector which works on the side, but up-and-down the privacy does not work. I don’t mind this because I know there physics behind this working. I gave this a two due to the screen protector cracking within a week. I don’t recall any large drops only on the table so for this to crack, whereas other screen protectors have lasted longer, (I’ve also bought this brand before) I am a little disappointed.",2
"(Photo #1 Amazon) (Photo #2 original privacy screen)
Bought these as a quick fix since I leave on a trip soon so I couldn’t order from the usual business but wow these are bad. NOT a privacy screen a better description would be “slightly dim/light tin screen”. Can’t imagine it protects from a fall; it’s paper thin and it doesn’t work as a privacy so I give it 2/5 it’s a decent cheap screen protector but don’t expect any level of privacy or protection",2
"I tried this on my iPhone 15 Pro today and Face ID no longer worked with the screen protector on (pulled it off and reapplied 5 times to see if the issue was positioning). Perhaps the circle cutout for the front camera needs to be larger.

I tried breaking it when I finally removed it to throw away, and it didn’t crack so it’s quite durable. But of no use to me if Face ID doesn’t work.",2
"Just got my 15PM after Christmas and was rocking the privacy screen and lens protector.. until a friend of mine with the same phone told me it’ll downgrade the visuals. Ends up he was right.. not only did the lens protector downplay my photos but even did so using RAW setting.. anywho, fast forward to now.. I’ve been feeling off about the front glass protector.. it definitely did its job with privacy as it’s advertised, but it add shade to the entire display itself! This is the first time I’m using my iPhone without a protector and I can tell you without a doubt it’s night and day.. at least 20% brighter. I’m sticking with this company because the protector was more than advertised I just wish I went with clear instead.. I ain’t got nothing to hide so I’ll rather have the brighter screen as Apple advertised 🥴

TLDR; 3 stars because it dimms the screen..
If that can be fixed I’ll give it 5",3
"This is a classic case of you get what you pay for, and I was not expecting anything more or less. I do not recommend applying it on your camera lens; Upon my first attempt I decided it was a no for me as it felt like it could potentially damage your camera. The screen protector itself hinders feedback in my opinion and while it does provide a desired privacy feature , it makes for a cheap appearance. I will be ordering a more costly protector from Zagg myself as I am quite picky but I will say it’s not unbearable it’s just not reliable on a permanent basis nor do I foresee it being durable. Regardless, some form of protection is far better than no protection for your smartphone screen.",3
"I won’t rely on the security of this. Depending on the lighting and how far the other person is next to you, people may still be able to see your screen. I really need a screen protector and love how thick the material is and easily install to the screen without bubbles. Yes it doesn’t cover the entire screen but good enough. Needed a lit space from the edge or the phone case might push it. The reason I have a 3 stars is that the screen protector does affect the Face ID. I will say 8 out of 10 times the Face ID won’t work but not a deal breaker for me.",3
"First of all - I found this privacy very difficult to install. The website and instructions say to use the ""alignment tool"" which mine didn't come with. Even when the screen is perfectly aligned it doesn't fit properly. I have an iPhone 15 Pro and found that it doesn't cover the entire screen - there is a little sliver around the perimeter.

It also cracks way too easily. I've already gone through 3 screens in the last 2 months and I've lost the will to replace it again.",3
"For the price, this screen protector does the job perfectly. I ended up removing and going with a higher quality privacy screen protector because the reduced clarity from the polarization. Might be hard to see unless zoomed in, but my picture shows that there are noticeable lines that run at about a 30° angle. This makes the screen look like it has a lower resolution and causes a headache for me when looking from my normal distance. I do have 20/10 vision so this might not be noticeable to everyone.",3
"Not sure if I just get a defective product based on the other reviews, but the privacy screen only works from certain angles. There is zero effect when I tilt the phone up or down, only from side to side. Very odd as I have used other screen protectors and never had this issue. As a screen protector this is great and I always go back to this brand as they are durable and protect the screen from hard drops; however, the privacy aspect is lacking.",3
"About four months in with this protector. The camera protector lasted about 18 hours before it shattered, and I have three giant cracks across the screen protector from having my phone in my pocket with my keys. It works, it’s not shattered, and it’s protected my screen, but I can say it’s not the most durable. I’ve had better. But I’ve also had worse. For the price, it’s as expected. Good temporary one while you find a good one.",3
"Anytime I’ve buttoned a privacy tint glass from AT&T, which uses a company called Zagg anytime I set on my phone. It never cracked within two weeks of having this product. I had my phone on my back pocket and I already had a crack across the screen so it does its job as far as privacy tent, but The quality of it the thickness of the glass it’s just not there",3
"I purchased this privacy screen protector two years ago and just now putting it to use. I like the fact that the screen is actually private without having to adjust the phone lighting. The downside of this screen protector is the Face ID is no longer active. You are unable to use this feature. However, I decided to reset my Face ID to see if I’d get lucky and it worked but I did have to login to all accounts that I use the Face ID with the original password and activate the Face ID feature again because once you try to login after applying the privacy protector it turns the feature off after you have been rejected a few times. Giving 4 stars because I had to set up Face ID to line up with lighting with new screen protector applied",3
"The screens are okay for privacy. You have to turn your phone pretty far to the side for the view to be fully blocked, but it still obscures a little bit before it gets to that point. In other words, it will block the view of someone casually glancing at your phone if they aren’t looking at it straight on, but it won’t block someone who is actively trying to read over your shoulder.

I’m more annoyed that they break so easily. I bought this a month ago and my second screen protector just broke. The first drop was, admittedly, pretty bad but this one was maybe a foot.

It was easy to install without bubbles, and I haven’t noticed any changes to my phone’s responsiveness or sensitivity or my camera quality.",3
"I liked the easy installation and clear instructions. It provided privacy and great quality. I gave one to my mother and I used the other one. Within a month both screens were cracked after minor falls. It isn’t very durable.",4
"When I first put on the screen protector, I was confused because the touch sensitivity on my phone was way off. What I mean is I couldn’t type well, couldn’t double tap the screen to turn on the phone, whatever.

Turns out it was because it was two screen protectors pretty much glued to each other. They were so seamless I had no idea there was two until I looked at the side, saw how thick it was, and pried the other one off.

Looking at the two other screen protectors that came in the package, the other ones were normal.

Overall, the screen protector works fine. Privacy filter works, but I have yet to drop test it. Just strange that it came packaged, and with two screens stacked on top of each other. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",4
"This is a comparison review of two privacy glass screen protectors for the iPhone 14 Pro Max:

1. Pehael [2+2 Pack] iPhone 14 Pro Max Privacy Screen Protector with Camera Lens Protector Full Coverage Anti-Spy Tempered Glass Film 9H Hardness Upgrade Edge Protection Easy Installation Bubble Free.
ASIN: B0B87SNR2L.
Price: $8.48 (originally $15.98, on sale at 47% off, on 2024/01/11).

2. Ailun 2Pack Privacy Screen Protector Compatible for iPhone 14 Pro Max[6.7 inch] + 2 Pack Camera Lens Protector, Anti Spy Private Tempered Glass Film, Case Friendly, [9H Hardness] - HD [Black].
ASIN: B0B76R521M.
Price: $8.89.

The first thing that is interesting is the difference in how many reviews Pehael has. It has a 4.4 star rating with 44,440 ratings for just this one item on this Amazon product page!! 5/4/3/2/1 star rating proportion is 71%/12%/7%/3%/6%.

On the other hand, Ailun also has a respectable 4.4 star rating with 41,577 ratings, but the Amazon product page has seven different styles including the iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPhone 13 Pro Max, iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Plus, and iPhone 15 Pro Max. Of the total 41577 ratings, 12,100 ratings are for the iPhone 14 Pro Max, where 8,879 ratings are 5 star (73.38%), 1,404 are 4 star (11.60%), 734 are 3 star (6.07%), 349 are 2 star (2.88%), and 734 are 1 star (6.07%).

This tells me a few things. A) There are probably more people who bought the Pehael screen protector on Amazon for their iPhone 14 Pro Max than Ailun’s. B) Pehael lists the screen protectors for the different styles separately, and a fair comparison cannot be made without crunching some numbers.

To create a fair comparison with Ailun that lists seven styles on one page, I pulled the numbers from Pehael’s product pages:

iPhone 13 Pro Max, 4.3 star with 18,160 ratings.
iPhone 14 Pro, 4.1 star with 1,376 ratings.
iPhone 15, 4.3 star with 220 ratings.
iPhone 15 Pro, 4.1 star with 340 ratings.
iPhone 15 Pro Max, 4.4 star with 487 ratings.
iPhone 15 Plus, 4.3 star with 204 ratings.

Combining the above numbers with the iPhone 14 Pro Max’s 4.4 star with 44,440 ratings, this totals to 65,227 ratings, with an average rating of 4.3636 stars. There’s obviously some rounding errors, as I only pulled the average rating for each of the above. While Pehael’s 4.3 star rating is less than Ailun’s 4.4, Pehael having 23,700 more ratings is a pretty good indicator that more people like Pehael’s products. Because an Amazon customer can only rate an item once no matter how many times he or she buys the product, this means that there are 23,700 more people rating it, on average, 4.3 stars.

(I wish Amazon would stop allowing sellers and manufacturers to lump all different styles into one product page. It makes shopping difficult. I get it if it’s a different color of a product with the same size and shape, but when the size and shape differ at all, they should just separate them.)

Anyway, the Pehael screen protector has a long oval cutout in what appears to be the bottom layer of the screen protector for the ambient light sensor, IR camera, and proximity sensor. The top layer is contiguous from edge to edge even for the front camera. Aliun, on the other hand, only has a round cutout in the bottom layer for the front camera, and does not have a cutout for the other sensors.

As far as the viewing angle, it’s about the same with the two brands. I placed both (formerly used and now cracked) screen protectors on the phone at a 90 degree angle to compare in the photos. The photos don’t show it very well, but the viewing angle is about the same. Pehael is to the left, and Aliun is to the right.

I think the pehael screen is a bit darker, and you can kind of see that in the photos.

The Pehael screen protector is also thicker. I didn’t take measurements, but it’s visibly thicker than the Aliun.

Both seem to be about equally resistant to cracks though, but this is totally anecdotal because there’s no good way to test that than to purposefully destroy them in a controlled manner.

All the extra pieces that come win the kit (wipes, etc) are all nearly the same.

If Pehael was at the full price of $15.98, and with it having similar durability as Aliun’s, paying almost twice as much seems like a lot. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen the Pehael sold at full price though.

I think I like the Pehael ones better.",4
"The pros:
* Privacy effect is very good
* Touch screen sensitivity is not affected
* Glass adequately protects screen

The cons:
* A bit difficult to install, especially on the newer iPhones with almost no bezel (and related: the installation video included is useless. It's less than 1 minute, doesn't mention how to use the stickers etc., and basically just says ""line up the protector and put it on the phone."")
* While the protector does indeed do a good job protecting the screen, I feel it's still a bit weak - even a minor drop leads to cracks across the screen protector and tiny spots of shattered glass along the edges. This isn't a huge problem though, given there are 3 in each pack and it's so affordable. I just wish I didn't have to put a new one on this frequently given how difficult it is to get it perfectly positioned.

4/5 overall and would recommend/would buy again, just some minor frustrations to note!",4
"This product does what it is supposed to, makes it difficult for others to see your screen. It isn’t perfect though. The “level” of privacy is dictated by how bright your screen is so if you have it on the highest then some things may be viewable by people at the right angle. I can’t comment on the durability but it felt fairly thick when I put it on my phone. I had to readjust it a couple of times and it didn’t break either.

One thing to note is that this screen protector is very reflective. Not a huge issue since that adds to the privacy factor but it does make it more difficult for FaceID. If there is a reflection, you will have to adjust your phone around a little to unlock it (if you use that feature). The protector also has an almost glass feel which is really nice.",4
"After buying an iPhone 15 Max I was looking for the protective screen cover. This one shipped immediately. Works great but the only issue I have is that the screen looks darker than normal. I'm 64. So, yes, I have eye sight issues. I like everything clear and bright. I have had to go on the the settings and turn up the brightness several times. That is my only complaint.",4
"So does this provide privacy from prying eyes? Yes. Is it easy to install? For sure. HOWEVER, note that the tech used in this particular screen protector to maintain that privacy does affect clarity. I expected having to bump up my brightness, but not the impact it has on the “HD-ness.” This is most noticeable right here, as I type and read small print. It does not heavily impact show viewing (though landscape mode offers minimal privacy, FYI. It’s designed more for vertical), but I notice while reading. So 4 stars for working as advertised, but a slight ding from me and my admittedly picky eyes.",4
"UPDATE: jk. It works! It is a bit finicky to find the angle where the faceID ir camera works, but it does work and just takes a bit of practice & patience. I wasted one of the three screens in the process of this. So, don’t be like me. I kept the second screen on for 2 days and can consistently get my faceID to properly function.

I was very excited to put a screen protector on my new phone (15). I decided to go with the privacy one because I like the idea of that. Once I got around to actually applying one, I was very disappointed to find that my FaceID wouldn’t work with it on. I took it off, and tried applying a second one, in the case it was my fault. Same thing happened. Maybe the non-privacy screen protectors actually work with FaceID. Return requested and my hunt for a privacy screen protector continues.
I will say that my touch screen functioned fine, they applied bubble-free, and my forward-facing camera worked, so I think the issue was with the tinting and the faceID camera specifically.",4
"I like the whole concept of a privacy screen protector. It works well. Just two things I dislike. One, it’s a bit hard to install. Most protectors come with a guide or a frame for installation. I basically lined up the camera hole and the speaker hole and hoped for the best. Two, my screen looks like it has a filter, certain images look like they have little lines running through it, sort of a grid style filter. Must be from the privacy aspect of the protector. Overall it’s good if installed correctly. Took me two try’s, luckily I didn’t have to waste a screen protector. I was able to lift and adjust. I find myself having to put up my brightness occasionally. But it’s all good. Hopefully it holds up.",4
"Overall these screen protectors do exactly what they are meant to do, protect the screen. However, they aren't very durable which is why I guess they come in a pack of three.",4
"I was impressed with the ease in which to apply the screen protector. I didn’t have any air bubbles. The back camera lense cover adheres very nicely. I had an issue; one of the protectors arrived damaged. I purchased from them before and had no issues. Mistakes occur so it wasn’t a big deal. Customer service replied back the very same day. I explained my issue. They took care of it right away. When both product and customer service are reliable, I’m a returning customer for life.",5
"It does what it says. You can’t see the screen even if you stand next to the phone owner. I asked my mom to check from different angles, she couldn’t see anything. She can only see it if she stands right behind me and the phone is facing straight. The only con is it is very easily to crack but it protects the phone screen well. I cracked the screen protector twice and am using the third one, the phone screen is intact without any scratches. I didn’t drop my phone at all, the screen protectors cracked when I opened my car door holding the phone in the same hand, it cracked that easily.",5
"these are my go to for screen protectors and i love how well the privacy screen works. it does crack after a few drops or one hard drop. i manage to crack it after a month or so. i personally don’t like having a screen protector over my camera, so i don’t use that.",5
"As a proud owner of the iPhone 13 Pro Max, privacy and safeguarding my device's camera lenses are paramount to me. The Ailun 2Pack Privacy Screen Protector and Camera Lens Protector set has proven to be an excellent solution to both these concerns, and I'm thoroughly impressed with the results.

"I have gone to BB, Tarjé and other stores to get these protective lenses and they all want to charge a ridiculous amount....usually $20-30 bucks. I bought the first one of these out of desperation because my usual store did not have the size for my phone and I was going out of town.
These are nice thick glass. So you know if you drop it on its face, it isn't going to hurt the phone. I am known for being abusive to my phones...I'm just very active and adventurous. Yes, I break my screens a lot, but at least now I don't have to pay $20 bucks a pop. These are easy to install and they look great, I love the privacy screen - it works really well. I can tell you that you won't be disappointed with this product - I have bought many packs for all our phones at home, and I keep a supply of spares due to my ""Activity"".",5
"Really like the privacy glass, easy to install and you get two for a great price highly recommend. Touch screen works flawlessly with the glass installed",5
"Seems like, with any screen protector, it doesn't matter if you use alcohol, compressed air, or even a leaf blower: some tiny bit of unseen dust will find a way to create a bubble in your protector. This one is no exception but at least it fits my iPhone perfectly and provides enough privacy to keep airline seatmates from checking out your Instagram feed (or your torrid WhatsApp chats!). Just take care to clean the screen as best you can, using all of the tools provided in the box: the alcohol wipes, the adhesive dust remover, etc. Then, with lots of light, take care on applying the protector as you typically get one shot.",5
"Okay so I have ocd bad when it comes to screen protectors and this one kind of bubbled a tad. Having turrets when I pulled the screen off I snapped it… I know I know I laughed after the fact but when it snapped it shot little glass all in my face some in my eyes thank god I had contacts in and got it out with one saline flush lol. That lil protector was a hard one to break tbh. Looks good and the back camera cover fits perfectly in my otter box case.",5
"This is the perfect screen protector and exactly what I needed! It was so easy to install and the privacy aspect of it works amazingly. The instructions to install it were straightforward and simple and I loved the cleaning materials it came with. And the best part was the price. The quality is great and I love that it came in a 2-pack! Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new screen protector.",5
"Listen to me. The camera protector covers all the camera space it is worth it!! Comes with 3 of each. (Camera and screen protectors). Screen protector definitely does as it says. From an angle it doesn’t go completely black but just dark enough to give the person next to you a hard time. WITHOUT IT DIMMING YOUR LIGHT SCREEN. So yess get it. Didn’t come cracked at all and with everything you need to install it.",5
"My Samsung Galazy A21 cell phone was at 0 percent power. i'd just received my Amazon shipment and excitedly unwrapped my new INUI power bank. I inserted my compatible [separately purchased] 3.0A USB-C fast charge cable. i noted the INUI power bank displayed 4 lit toes- approximately equivalent to 75 percent fully charged.(?) I first charged up the INUI to replenish the power level to have all portions of the paw design lit [i didn't time this]. I just preferred to start with full power.

I proceeded with then using the INUI powerbank to charge my phone.

One hour later, my phone displayed 9 percent charged. I double checked: my Samsung was indeed set to *fast charging* mode. Three hours later, my phone was at 67 percent .. HOWEVER .. the INUI power lever was at 0 ...* ZERO ... percent * ... NO TOES and NO portion of the paw were lit. I don't know how long the INUI lasted before the power was ZEROed out.

In summary, in a matter of 3 hours, the INUI power was fully depleted. And my Samsung android phone was ..not.. fully charged, nullifying the claims in the ad/ description.

I'm disappointed, to say the least. As an animal welfare supporter, i'd been attracted to the paws-n-toes design that correlates with the level of power / charge in the INUI: paw with 4 toes lit is approximately 75 percent full, etc. The design sort of made the mundane risk of charging one's phone, a bit of fun.

I recharged the INUI to its full capacity of power, using my 3.0A cable, and the compatible 3.0A USB wall adapter, but failed to time it.

i'm returning the unit. I don't trust it, and can't rely on it, which defeats the criterion used to justify the purchase. ARGGH, I wish the INUI worked!",1
"Bought this portable charger as a gift and am totally embarrassed! Brand new out of box, charged once and totally dead, nothing. When I learned of this, I try to reset product, try on different phones, try with different cords, nothing works, totally dead. I then go back to Amazon to see about returning and the return window is closed and when I check with the manufacturer (INIU), they offer a 3 year warranty, but try to figure out how to return! The shipping to China is at my cost for a product they sold that does not work! The return shipping will cost more then the original product cost. Instead of returning, I will buy a new one from another company.",1
"I'm a senior. Not smart about all this newfangled technology. Bought this without understanding it only works on certain phones. I have an android Samsung AO3s. Didn't realize it was only for iPhones and certain other number samsungs. So much of this language is Greek to me. An expensive lesson for this ol' gal! I hate throwing money down the drain....",1
"This is the second one of these I received. The first one stopped working after 2 months and it was replaced with the one I have now, that does not work at all.
It doesn't look like they are going to replace this defective one at all.
Not sure what's going on, but I would not recommend this product.",1
"This thing was useless. It charges so slow I have an S23 Ultra and if I plugged it up usb-c to usb-c it would talk ove 2 1/2 hours to fully charge. My factory car charger is faster than that. Returning for another brand that hopefully supports super fast charging or fast charging at the very least",1
"Defective. Nvr used, device won't come on/ charge.
Purchased at recommendation of a group leader for my daughter's trip to Europe. Purchased early. When it arrived, opened, inspected & charged it. Device seemed ok. Now we are close to trip (and OUTSIDE return window), and it WON'T WORK! It won't come on, or charge. I even purchased a new USB adapter and left it for hours and nothing.",1
"I have had nothing but trouble with this charger, the “paw print” indicates how much charge life is on the charger and as soon as I go to use it it goes down to 60% charge life. I wish I would’ve saved the box because I would have sent it back.
Don’t buy this charger",1
"No practical first because theres some like my old one you open the usb to both side and you can charge very easy . this one after you charge maybe 2 hours more . for me doent work the only thing I give 1 start for the color but its also to heavy",1
"I bought this less than two months ago and already it’s broken and won’t hold a charge. At first I thought it was my charger that was broken, but then I got a new charger and this portable battery still won’t charge. Not worth it. You get what you pay for",1
"I returned this for a refund it was open and used and there was no charger to charge the portable charger this is happening more and more where things are shipped and have been opened used and pieces are missing especially when it is shipped from parts of the country and not shipped locally so now I look to see where things are shipped from before I order them",1
"I bought this battery when a previous battery (a different brand) stopped working. I like the slim, light weight design and was impressed with the 100000 mAh capacity. However, I also bought a heated fleece vest that comes with a 4800 mAh battery that I will be using on an upcoming trip to a much colder climate. I wanted to see how long it would take for this 10000 mAh portable charger to provide a full charge to the 4800 mAh battery for the vest. battery. If I am doing the math correctly, it should be able to fully charge the vest battery 2 times. Well, that's not what happened. I plugged them together for a charge with vest battery at 25%. Three hours later, this charger is dead and the vest batter is only at 70%. That is only a 45% increase. Not what I was hoping for or expecting, to say the least.",2
"So I was super excited to get this charger, it is lightweight, looks nice, I love the cute little paw 🐾 on it... Only issue is it takes Forever to charge, and then dies way to fast.... Most portable chargers give u at least a few different charges but definitely not this one. This one honestly is the worst one I own, especially for the price I paid.. would not recommend at all. Matter of fact if I could return it and get my money back I wouldd.",2
"I charged up fully a couple days before a trip. When I tried to use on trip, it was no longer charged. My return window was closed by that time. Not satisfied especially since you have to carry a charging cable also.",2
"I don’t know if my battery is broken or if it just made this way but I have to unplug the cord from the battery unit and then plug it back in each time I want to charge my phone. If I leave the cord plugged into the unit and then plug my phone into the cord it won’t charge. Also the battery life isn’t great. I charged my phone once and the next day when I went to charge it again the battery was almost completely drained. I’ll keep it and use it till it dies but I won’t ever buy this one again or recommend it to anyone because it’s a big hassle.",2
"I have had this produce since May of last year and it has quit charging. I can charge the battery but it does not charge the phone and the lights do not work.",2
"At first one of them worked great , we bought 2 BUT one of the USB ports was damaged . To much hassle to send back so we kept them . Not a full month later still takes awhile to recharge , but won't completely charge a phone without running out of charge VERY quickly . Wouldn't buy again .",2
"This product worked very well until it stopped working altogether! It was easy to use and a handy size. But, all of a sudden it refused to charge our phones. We checked all the connections, followed the troubleshooting steps, and it still did not work. That’s not very good for a product to conk out after three months.",2
"I bought this charger to have for my Apple 13. The plug that you’re going to the Apple 13 is too big I have to use my own Apple wire.",2
"Purchased in Aug 2023. Worked beautifully for six months. Will no longer charge when plugged in to the wall. Seems like a short lifespan for a battery pack.",2
"Works well if you only need it to charge your phone one time. I had another battery pack that I could use multiple times before having to charge. This one can only be used once before it needs charged. So it works well if you only need to charge your phone once.",2
"UPDATE 3/1/22: I had written the review (below) giving my unbiased opinions of the INIU portable charger. The points I made in the review were my honest assessments of the product. I had never contacted the company prior to my review and only made this one Amazon review about the B1-41 power bank. I did have concerns and posted them in my review. Unexpectedly, I received an e-mail from INIU wanting to know how they could alleviate my concerns about the product. I responded to INIU's (Karlin at INIU) inquiry and the company went above and beyond to alleviate my dislikes about the product! I will have to say I have never had a company or their customer service department respond to a review wanting to do everything possible to help me like their product! They have been more than helpful and I am very happy with the product now. Since the review below, I have now charged my i-Phone X from this power bank and it charged the phone 3 times before needing to recharge the power bank. I am very happy with the product, the customer service department (Karlin), and their effort to make a customer happy! Thanks, INIU, and Karlin! Keep up the great customer service!!

I purchased the INIU Portable Charger with 10,000 mAh of stored power. It has an LED light (not real bright, but could light a door lock or a path directly in front of you at night), the paw footprint charge indicator (which shows the status on the charger in 20% increments), power button on side, 2 USB-A output ports, and a USB-C input and output port. The accessories that come with it are a short (~12 inches) USB-C cable (that has a USB-A connection on one end and a USB-C on the other end to charge the charger with), a short ""Welcome Guide"" (or instructions), and a travel pouch (which is a netted nylon material with a draw string). The travel pouch will do little to protect the device from the elements (rain/water/dust/etc) or accidental drops.

I have now charged the power charger. It came with a slight charge on it so I plugged it in to charge. The charger cannot be charged directly from a wall plug but has to have a computer USB-A port or a 5V/2A USB adapter to charge the power charger. It does not come with a USB adapter plug, that would plug into a wall, so you must use a computer port or purchase (unless you already have one) a USB adapter to charge the INIU power charger with. My charger has just finished charging for the first time and it took over two and a half hours to charge the INIU power charger from a 5V/2A adapter plugged into a 120V electric wall outlet. (I am uncertain how long it would take from a computer's USB port at this time.) As it charges, the paw print blinks and each ""paw"" will light up as the charge increases in 20% increments (thus 5 paw prints). When it finishes charging, the entire paw lights up with a steady blue glow. (I have not charged my phone/iPad yet with this device.)

The part I am concerned about is having to carry a 5V/2A adapter charger to charge the power charger with. It would have been nice if it would have plugged directly into any standard wall socket. Also, you have to have the USB charging cable that came with the charger, since it has a USB-A connector on one end and a USB-C connector on the other end. The USB-C port on the charger is the only way you charge this charger! You cannot use a lightning connector (iPhone) with this device to CHARGE it. You can use a lightning connector to charge your iPhone from this device though. So, you have to have two different cables with you to use this device.....one for charging the charger and one to charge you phone/iPad. Do not forget the 5V/2A adapter charger either.....as it doesn't come with accessory!

It is small (5-3/8 inches long x 2-3/4 inches wide x 1/2 inch deep) and will fit well in a purse or shirt/coat pocket. It is totally black, except for the white paw print (when not lighted....blue when lit). Two phones/devices can be charged at the same time. It has a 30 day money back guarantee, a 3 year warranty, and ""lifetime technical support"". There is NO phone number or address to contact the manufacturer listed, only an email address. It is made in China.",3
"Hello! I bought this about a year ago and I really like that it is as thin as most phones, holds a lot of battery and has a power indicator. The downfall is there’s this flashlight on it that comes on randomly and I can’t seem to turn it off because I see no buttons on the power bank and no info online about the flashlight. Unfortunately the light has been on for 4 days now and has not turned off on its own like it did the last time the light came on. If anyone has info on how to control the flashlight that would be helpful, thank you.",3
"I've had a portable charger from Walmart that I've used for years and never had any issues with. I came here looking for something a little slimmer. I found this and saw the abundance of reviews on it and immediately bought it. Then I saw the case and got it too. And with that I decided to get a matching charging cord. I waited over 3 weeks for the charger itself. I pay for prime, so the other 2 things I had within 2 days. Anyways, I get the charger, it came over 50% charged which was nice. I hook it up to charge the rest of the way, it took a few hours which is normal for a portable charger. I love the look of it. What I'm not liking so far is how slow it is. It takes way longer than my house charger and my Walmart portable charger. The one I have from Walmart is pretty fast, so I only assumed buying a good quality name brand would be even better. Again I mainly wanted something more slim. But I'd rather carry around the faster one than this. I'm disappointed honestly. This would have to be a last resort use if anything.",3
"My iphone is not the newest, is the 12 promax and it does not for that one even though i read everything, called customer service to see if they had one the same for my old iphone but the agent tried the best and did not find one, so even i always read customers reviews and specifications this did not fit my old iphone that says it does hope i could get the same one for my iphone 12 pro max u need to have the 15 pro",3
"This charger comes with an android only cord. Although it says it's compatible with iPhone it's not unless you buy a separate cord which still has a USB (which is fine because this item has USB ports) but you can't use the regular iPhone to USBc (or lightning) iPhone cord with this charger. Very disappointed.

If you have an android phone, it's great. iPhone users, beware.",3
"Physically, it's a nice looking charger. Nice texture, cute power indicator, and love the flashlight. However, I can only get maybe 1 or 2 charges before I have to charge the portable one again (and it takes FOREVER to charge the portable battery). I'll probably end up sending it back. I've had my anker for a few years now and it's only now starting to die.",3
"That is a beautiful product . But I really dislike the fact I finally using it, and it is way far from an high speed charger like you said. You guys don't need to lie to sell your product. It's a good charger, but it's not fast at all. At least not for my Samsung galaxy S21 U.",3
"I bought this product in May 2023. I have used it, maybe 10 times total. Here we are 10 months later and it won’t hold a charge. I left it plugged up for hours and hours and no charge at all.",3
"I actually like it for 20 bucks it gets the job done. The three ports two USB and one USC I think it drains a little quickly but over good. I gave three stars cause it is a cheap product",3
"It charges your phone fast
but the battery doesn't last on the charger, 3 hours use and it was almost without battery. It's just good if you only used a couple hours.
We only need it when traveling.",3
"I bought this May 2021 and it's lasted this long. I love how compact it is. Never had a problem with charging it or charging anything with it. I have an Motorola edge and it has worked great with it. I was able to get several charges from it before it needed to be charged. I'm about to go on a cruise in a few weeks and I planned to take it with me but unfortunately it has stopped charging all the way. I've had it plugged in for hours and it's only gotten as far as the bottom pad on the paw print. No toes light up anymore. It will only charge my phone once now before it runs out. Still keeping it because it basically still works but I'm getting a new one. Hopefully the new one will work just as good.",4
"I like the slim build. It’s almost the size of my phone. It will charge my phone or iPad up twice before it needs recharging itself. I was hoping I would get more charge out of it than that, but I only use it in case I forgot to charge one of my devices up and have no other means to charge it. It comes with a short cord that is used for recharging it and for charging my android phone, and maybe an android tablet, too, I don’t know as I don’t have one of those. I already had a short usb port iPhone/iPad cord that can be used to charge those devices, otherwise you have to buy one. I am able to charge two devices at the same time. The four stars instead of five is because it doesn’t come with an iPhone/iPad charge cord ( note: this cord has to have one end of it usb port and the other end iPhone/iPad compatible. I bought it on Amazon ) and it doesn’t hold as much charge as my old bulky portable charger that held enough charge to recharge a device 4 times instead of only 2 times. That being said, I didn’t find another device that could either, and I am still happy to have this charger.",4
"So, I ended up buying 3 of these at the $18 sale price. I bought one and tested it and then bought another two. At $18 it is a good value. Compared with a fast charging battery I have from RETMSR, made in China, as well which is 6.77x3.43x1 inch and weighs just over a pound (yes, its a chunk but not quite a doorstop), this battery is just 5.2x2.7x0.5 inches and is a mere 7 ounces. Note also that I have not tried to charge anything from USB-C port (which says its both Input and Output - I remain skeptical on that one). And it is not a fast charger, either. While it had no trouble charging my E7 Bluetooth headphones in about 90 minutes to 100%, my Samsung Galaxy phone took 6-1/2 hours to go from 17% to 96%. Still not bad at all for the difference in size and weight! I gave it 4 stars and would have gone 4-1/2 but Amazon doesn't do half stars (insert smiley face here).",4
"Purchased this power bank (INIU B1-B5 20000mAh) due to seeing YouTube review of several PBs where reviewer took apart several PBs and showed that the batteries used in the PBs were actually rated far below the claimed capacities. INIU was one of few brands whose battery (in this case 20000mAh) label actually matched the advertised capacity. IOW, some brands that advertised 20000mAh capacity actually had batteries in them that were listed at 10000mAh etc.

I used an old iPhone 7plus (with a 2900mAh battery) to charge from 50% back to 100% (or 1450mAh). The INIU B1-B5 went from 100% down to 86% (test was done three times with same results). Due to voltage conversion from the 3.7v battery to 5v USB output, the effective total capacity of the PB should be around (3.7/5)*20000 or 14800mAh. Since 14% of the PB was used, this amounts to 2072mAh. Since 2072 mAh of output from the PB was used to effectively charge 1450mAh of the phone battery, this amounts to a 70% charging efficiency. This means that I would get around 3.57 charges of my old iPhone 7plus out of this 20000mAh battery power bank.

IIRC, I read somewhere that the expected efficiency of power banks should average around 80-85% due to conversion losses. At 70% loss, this power bank does not seem to be every efficient (although in my test, this may be due in part to the fact that the phone used is an old one).

The positives: This power bank did charge my phone from 50% to 100 % in 1hr 57min which is pretty good given the iPhone 7plus is not fast charge (PD) capable. In my short time with the INIU, it seems to hold a charge well, did not heat up and did not heat up the phone while charging. It was also consistent in the charge times.

The neutrals: While the thickness and weight of the unit does not lend itself to carry in a pocket while charging your phone (see specs on Amazon page), it is compact enough to easily carry in your carry on luggage as at a rated 74Wh it is well below the 100Wh limit imposed by the FAA and airlines. While it did underperform regarding capacity vs what it is advertised to be able to do, it was not as bad as some of the other power banks I tested, and came the closest to the advertised capacity as compared to some of the others I tested.

The negatives: All power banks seem to use misleading specs in their advertising. Just because the power bank has a “20000mah” battery, does not mean that it will charge a device with, say a 4000mAh battery 5 times. Far from this due to various conversion losses etc. Also, I assume that these conversion losses can vary quite a bit between various power banks. While this power bank seems to not be very efficient, it met my needs (especially for the price).

Unknowns: I have only just gotten this power bank and have only used it 4 times to charge my phone from 50% back to 100%. I anticipate using it primarily for travel. I have read reviews warning of battery pack swelling and failure etc over time. I have not had any problems with it so far but have used it for less than one week. So time will tell. In the meantime, my spouse also bought one as well so we will see.",4
"It’s pretty good quality for the price and I couldn’t expect more from something as small as it is. Though it’s small and compact it has its obvious flaws that make this review a 4/5. These flaws include a lower battery life than most others for about the same price. Although it has its advantages its durability is decent for its price and the compact nature of the design makes it a perfect emergency travel tool. My advice is if you are looking for a good travel power bank and only use it for emergency charging I definitely wouldn’t recommend it enough. Though if you’re looking into a multi use power bank and want multiple charges I would pull some more money to buy a more expensive and convenient power bank to use.",4
"I reached out to support and they were on top of it. They quickly sent a replacement. Thank you. I bought this in October 2023 and as of yesterday it will not charge up. I checked the cord, tried others. Nothing. I am emailing the company for any recourse. Stay tuned.",4
"I bought this to use when I’m doing Instacart since their app literally drains your battery after two shops. This is great to keep on you for emergencies as well. The only reason I’m not giving it 5 stars is due to the fact that the battery drains quickly and you have to charge it every day.",4
"When I received this, it was at roughly 80% charged. I plugged my phone into it and charged it from roughly 68% to 95%. It took maybe 30 minutes if that. When finished it was at roughly 20% charged. I have it on the charger right now, so we’ll see how it goes!",4
"I saw this on TikTok. It had a ton of great reviews. I trust Amazon. When I saw it, I bought it!
So, glad I did!
Was delivered in less than 24hrs! What a surprise!
It came 50% charged. Easy set up.
Comes with a mesh-like case .
Thank you!",4
"I purchased two of these batteries. The size is very nice, the padded bag is nice too. It feels quality and should work great for the heated vest I purchased it to power. I did an ah test on one of the batteries, like I do for ALL lithium batteries. The test showed that these batteries DO NOT have the rated power in them. My test produced 6.07 ah of power. These are rated for 10,000 mah which is 10 ah's. These are really rated at 6,000 mah. The price is nice but it you want full power then I suggest going with a different brand. I may return these and get ones that hopefully test out to their rated power. This is something we consumers need to watch. We can be duped so easily when it comes to lithium batteries. I make sure all of my lithium batteries have their full capacity. These are the first batteries I've tested that do not meet the advertised rating.",4
"I got this since my older battery chargers were on their way out. I saw this one and wanted to try it out, and needless to say after a while of using this battery, its wondeful!

This battery has a lot of flexibility -- 3 overall ports that all allow charging. The USB C port that allows you to charge the battery also allows you to charge your devices which is a great advantage to other batteries. It does its job wondefully and charges my phone (Android in this case) in a reasonable time compared to my other charging ports. Its very easy to tell when your battery is low and comes with a cute pouch! It fits in your pockets seamlessly. It also has a little built in flashlight, which, I don't use often but definitely comes into clutch sometimes.

I would recommend keeping the battery out of its mesh pocket when charging. It heats up a little when charging but only near the area of charging. As well, the charging cord for the battery is a bit on the shorter side but still can charge on any personal USB C cords.

I would recommend this battery for anyone!",5
"I got this based on reviews plus my daughter wanted a solid battery charger for her iPhone 14 Pro Max because she doesn’t like the mag chargers. This came partially charged. Love the soft texture feel, not any heavier than a mag charger but larger. It was the exact size of my iPhone 13. The optional multi charge abilities was also a plus. We purchased another quality known brand mag first but couldn’t even get it to charge or turn on. It went back immediately and we got this. My daughter loves the paw battery indicator light. Hopefully it works long term. It had a link you could scan for video, instructions, and other products, and support in addition to the paperwork included. It also came with cable and soft mesh bag to carry it in. So far upon opening and first charge we are very happy with this purchase. Simple, lightweight, easy to use charger what’s not to love?",5
"I Honestly got nothing bad to say at all about this product. I don't write many reviews on things but this power bank is just great to have around. I carry it in my bag everywhere I go. It's super light weight, charges fast, lasts long and the paw print design is awesome for any animal lover out there. I'd definitely give it 5 stars and two paws up.",5
"What I love the most is this feels like a well made product that has what everyone wants without being too overly engineered or gimmicky.
The overall design feels durable enough to use as a daily driver. I also confirmed it could charge two devices at the same time with no issues. It won't do Fast or Super Fast charging on my Samsung Note 20 Ultra, but I also don't expect it to at this price range. I also love that the USB-C is both in and outgoing power.
For the price point it's everything I wanted in a power bank.
Also the added light isn't pro grade, but it's actually pretty good for an added feature. It's nothing special but plenty of light for those situations where maybe you dropped something or need to read some text.
If I had to list a con... I guess the charging cable is small (approx 1ft), but this is plenty imo. If you're charging a power bank, it's probably staying near the charger. Maybe it could have come with two cables, but I'd rather use my own longer cables for charging my actual phone. So really I prefer it this way, but someone may not like that the included cable is so short. If that's you, then go buy a longer cable with this. The Iniu still feels like the best device for the money right now, and I really like it personally.
UPDATE: It charged my phone in about 30 minutes from around 30% to 85% (where I cap the charge). For standard charging, that's exactly what I expect. Easy 5* product with everything else said.",5
"Embarking on a journey to find the perfect portable charging companion led me to the INIU Portable Charger, a promising device boasting a 10000mAh capacity coupled with USB-C in & out technology for high-speed charging. Designed to be the power lifeline for a range of devices from the iPhone 15 to the Samsung S22, its sleek form and robust specs appeared tailor-made for the demands of a modern, mobile lifestyle.

However, as the glossy sheen of initial impressions faded, the reality of daily use painted a starkly different picture. The integration of the INIU Portable Charger into my tech routine revealed several significant flaws, starkly contrasting with the high expectations set by its advertised capabilities. This stark discrepancy prompted a thorough reassessment of its effectiveness and utility in my digital ecosystem.

Pros:

🌐 Versatile Compatibility: Initially, the charger’s compatibility was its most appealing feature, promising seamless integration with a wide array of devices. This universal compatibility was a beacon of convenience, envisaged to simplify the charging needs of my tech-laden life. Envisioning a world where a single charger could meet all my devices' energy needs, the INIU Portable Charger seemed like a dream accessory, eliminating the need for multiple chargers and simplifying my tech setup.

Cons:

Questionable Capacity: Despite its promising 10000mAh capacity, the charger's actual performance was underwhelming. It consistently struggled to fully recharge my devices, often depleting its stored power after a single use. This glaring discrepancy between advertised and real-world capacity became a source of frustration, leaving me in need of additional charging solutions far sooner than expected. The reliability I sought in a portable charger was compromised, as the INIU Portable Charger failed to deliver the endurance and dependability it promised, making it difficult to trust as a primary power source for important devices.

Pros:

💼 Sleek Design: The design of the INIU Portable Charger was undoubtedly its strong suit. Its slim, lightweight profile made it an attractive and practical choice for inclusion in daily carry, promising not to add unnecessary bulk. The aesthetic appeal of the charger, with its modern lines and minimalistic style, was designed to complement the array of devices it was intended to support, suggesting that functionality and form had been considered in equal measure. This thoughtful design was a reminder that portable power could indeed be both effective and elegant, fitting seamlessly into both professional and casual contexts.

Cons:

🔄 USB-C Limitations: The inclusion of USB-C technology in the charger was a key selling point, suggesting a step forward in charging efficiency and speed. However, the reality was a letdown. The USB-C port's performance fell short of current standards, with charging and data transfer speeds lagging behind those of other devices in my tech arsenal. This underperformance was particularly noticeable during critical moments when fast charging was not just preferred but necessary. The slow recharge rate via USB-C, a standard I had come to rely on for its rapid power delivery, meant that the charger was often bypassed in favor of more reliable alternatives, undermining its position as a go-to charging solution.

Reflecting on the experience with the INIU Portable Charger, it's evident that while it promised to be an all-encompassing power solution, the reality was a blend of style over substance. The sleek design and broad device compatibility initially suggested a future where charging concerns were alleviated. Yet, the shortcomings in capacity and the underwhelming USB-C performance highlighted significant gaps between its potential and actual utility. This journey from anticipation to disappointment underscores the critical need for portable chargers to not only meet but exceed the demands of the modern digital landscape.

As I continue the search for a truly reliable portable charger, the lessons learned from the INIU Portable Charger experience remain front and center. The quest for a device that seamlessly marries form with function, offering dependable, high-speed charging without compromise, goes on. Here's to hoping the next charger not only matches but surpasses expectations, keeping our devices—and by extension, our lives—powered and uninterrupted.",5
"I bought this as a gift for someone needing a phone charger. The recipient is pleased with its features and performance. Though it takes some time to charge fully, it recharges a phone several times. They especially liked the paw print battery life meter. I would definitely consider purchasing INIU products in the future.",5
"I bought this for a week-long cruise and it was very useful and convenient. Super simple to use and kept my phone charged when I needed it. I took a lot of photos on my trip and this reliably kept my phone charged.
It's so light and slim that I could connect it to my phone and then put both in my hoodie pocket or cross-body bag. I didn't use the little flashlight feature but it's a cute option, as is the paw print indicator of how much charge is left. I bought a short, high-speed charging cable and my phone charged quickly.
This product seems sturdy and well-made so I expect it to last throughout future trips.",5
"I currently don’t own a portable charger and thought one might be useful if on a long hike, out and about, or on vacation. I did quite a bit of research and saw that Project Farm on YT has reviewed this INUI BI-B41, along with many others, and it was one of the top chargers, also with a good Amazon rating. The brother of this, the BI-B61 came out marginally better but it has above average Amazon returns and the form factor, small but thick, was not as pocketable for my needs. I also didn’t need a vulnerable, built-in phone stand, so, I bought this one.
.
It arrived with about 50-60% charge. I didn’t time how long it took to fast-charge it, but it was at least an hour. Project Farm has all the details for charging power and times. The supplied, short USB -A to USB-C is obviously not a fast-charging cable for my Pixel 6a. I used my own USB-C to USB-C fast-charge cable and the phone did charge at the anticipated fast-charge rate and was equivalent to my 20W charging brick. I usually only charge between 25% and 80% to prolong the battery life, and to get the quickest charge time (as you approach 100% the charge rate in a phone will automatically drop to a crawl as part of the battery management algorithm). I’ve used the charger on my headphones, phone, and earbuds. I will also use it for my mirrorless camera batteries in the future. It does not get hot.
So far, it is working as I expect. It is also similar, in terms of size, to a small phone, so it fits nicely in my pockets.
.
I’m not keen on the LED “animal paw” symbol. I’d much rather have a row of 4 or 5 LEDs, or a percentage readout. The paw looks childish. Each of the 4 pads indicates the level of charge in 25% increments, and the level of charge has a flashing pad when charging. The LED is very bright in a dark room but you can always turn it on its back.
.
At $20, this is a very good buy. Hopefully the 3-year warranty, if required, is honored. I will be back to update this review should I have any issues.
.
So far - Highly recommended for your consideration!",5
"I recently got my hands on a portable charger adorned with a cute blue dog print, and it's been nothing short of delightful. Not only does it boast a charming design, but its fast-charging capabilities ensured my device's battery was replenished efficiently. I'm so impressed that I've decided to bring three of these chargers with me for my upcoming two-week trip to Japan.

Pros:
- **Adorable Design:** The cute blue dog print adds a touch of personality to the portable charger, making it stand out in a sea of generic options.
- **Fast Charging:** The charger lived up to its promise of fast charging, providing a quick and efficient power boost for my devices.
- **Perfect for Travel:** With three of these companions in tow, I'm confident that I'll stay powered up throughout my entire two-week trip to Japan.

In summary, this portable charger has exceeded my expectations with its charming design and reliable fast-charging capabilities. I'm excited to take it along on my travels, knowing that it will be a dependable companion for keeping my devices charged and ready for action.",5
"I have been searching for a power pack for my new Samsung S23 Ultra for a while. Ordered one a bit ago but returned it. Although it could probably have charged my house in a blackout---it was WAY to HEAVY and BULKY for my purse. However, THIS NIU Portable Charger, USB C Slimmest & Lightest Triple 3A High-Speed 10000mAh Power Bank, is ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.

It fits quite nicely in my purse; does NOT weigh 3 lbs like the other did - LOL. I got the blue one, not that it matters, but as a DOG PERSON, I absolutely love the charging indicator lights in the shape of a pawprint. Works for cat people, too, LOL.

Anyway, I had a dental appt this morning and noticed my phone was down to 33%. Plugged it into my INIU and tucked it all into my purse. By the time I got home (an hour+); my phone was charged! With lots of juice left in the power pack.

It's just so convenient. Comes with a mesh bag to place the charger & cord into your bag, coat pocket, purse, etc. Going skiiing? Mountain biking? A nice long walk? Don't worry about losing phone battery; this will definitely buy you another whole round of power for photos :-)",5
"I'm using my Apple device cable and this charger seems to work plenty good and fast for my immediate need, but this review is about far more than present appearance.

To complete what I have to say, among other things, I will nimbly touch on what's been understated elsewhere as the Rat’s Nest of USB-C Standards, but only when it comes to charging, not data transfer. Like most reading this, I'm just wanting to get beyond being a novice, the perspective which should be of special importance.

Here's what Apple says (and what I initially recently read) about fast charging for some of their devices: one can use [list of relevant Apple adaptors] or a ""comparable third-party USB-C power adapter that supports USB Power Delivery (USB-PD)"". On its website, Apple boldly claims this exact power adapter is ""Compatible with any USB-C enabled device."" Yet the documentation that comes with it says you ""might"" be able to use it on third-party phones depending on the region, and to ""Check with the manufacturer about compatibility with any third-party phone before charging."" Apple abstains from providing the version of the PD standard the adapter adheres to, further subverting the specious compatibility claim. The USB-C Power Delivery standard is as old as the USB-C standard itself but it has undergone major revisions and not all vendors (or their specific products) claim to adhere to a PD standard, apparently because they don't. Interestingly, one can't (rather shouldn't) use just any USB-PD charger with any Apple USB-C device as device model compatibility is required before a charger can even be ""comparable."" Third-party chargers implementing PD must test for compatibility with specific Apple devices which obviously goes beyond which version of PD is implemented on the Apple device - unless that's only because Apple (I believe) DOES NOT release PD version information period. Furthermore, Apple even provides (extremely) limited information on detail testing regarding their own chargers and devices to document established compatibility! So what exactly does a test entail? Your guess is as good as mine.

USB-PD (USB-C Power Delivery) allows the device (/load) and power supply to negotiate for multiple standard (set) power delivery levels. Current versions of the PD specification are 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1.

PD PPS (Programmable Power Supply) is a supplemental specification to USB Power Delivery describing how the device (/load) and power supply communicate for granular and incremental power delivery levels. The charging device and the power recipient exchange information on which voltage and ampere values are supported. The efficiency of PPS comes with the benefit of lessening heat which increases battery lifespan. I do not believe Apple ever mentions PPS which was introduced with PD 3.0, and is optional. Judging from the couple of comments I found, Apple was still using PD 2.0 long after PD 3.0 was introduced, so it's possible that 2.0 is still what's mostly being used and/or no PPS!

The one exception I found to Apple being mum on details and versions of the standards they use is a report that Apple confirmed to The Verge that their 140W USB-C Power Adapter uses USB-PD 3.1. There is a surprising dearth of reports from people who possess test equipment to analyze and verify the standards that Apple's adaptors (and devices) support. Also, I should mention that where wireless charging is merged with USB charging from a power adapter, USB charging standards and requirements remain in place. Wireless charging requires its own protocols for negotiating the amount of power transferred. For the wireless power transfer end, we have Apple's proprietary MagSafe standard in addition to the open Qi and Qi2 standards that Apple helped create. Burp.

Note that ALL OF the device, the charger, and the cable must meet USB version specification requirements (or corresponding rating) to achieve highest or acceptable (and possibly safe) protocol compliance and therefore proper charging! Yet I believe Apple's implementations are all considered proprietary. For sure there is an abundance of companies with various proprietary USB-C fast charging schemes. Something has to give. The good news is that devices have built-in limits and should reduce current when necessary to only draw as much power as they’re capable of handling.

Apple is a founding and current member of the working group that develops the USB standards. As long as manufacturers make no effort to better inform their customers on the standards being used, the situation will continue to be a stinking USB rat's nest, USB-C or not. Admittedly, the ignorant will not be concerned regarding the full extent of the mess (until we get burned) - especially those of us who have been simple and largely faithful users of the chargers that came with our devices. Except now the chargers are separately purchased items. That Apple is going all in on USB-C is good, but if they really want us to get the most out of our devices (and/or our batteries), and if they desire to be responsible members of society, they need to reveal more. Blindly maximizing the use of individual chargers and cables can mean wasting devices and batteries instead. Apple doesn't seem to have known as much about battery charging as they might have as optimal lithium battery charging advice has continued to evolve as has Apple's algorithm for slowing the last segment of charging.

The model number given on this Amazon page for this adapter/charger is MHJA3AM/A which I believe it should be called a manufacturer (part) number - except that Apple is unsurprisingly good with it being called a model number here, confusion be damned. The model number of the adapter I received is A2305. The accompanying two-inch square instruction book combines nine models. The typical difference in the models relates in part to the AC input voltage range*, obviously to satisfy local government regulations. The only place USB-PD is mentioned in the booklet is with the adapter output specification. USB-PD is NOT placed as an input specification (I think Belkin does the same) even though Power Delivery can't function without same language communication!

*Update/addition: After answering a question from someone planning to travel to Morocco with this charger, I took a better look at the io specs in the tiny instruction pamphlet and I'm taking a crack at explaining (more like deciphering since my understanding of electricity is limited basic).

There are 9 models covered in the accompanying pamphlet and 6 of the 9 have identical io specifications fully stated as follows:

Models A2244, A2245, A2247, A2305, A2347, and A2464

> Input: 100-240V~50-60Hz 0.5A
> (USB-PD) Output: 5VDC/3A or 9VDC/2.22A

What I understand from this is that this adaptor will work the same for any normal AC plug. Its output is only Power Delivery because it charges at two possible standard/set levels, to be negotiated with the device being charged. It can charge at:
5V x 3A = 15 Watts (Volts times Amps equals Watts)
and
9V x 2.22A = 19.98 Watts

So this adapter is only capable of charging at either 15 Watts or 19.98 Watts.

I'm trying to understand the USB-C Power Delivery table at Wikipedia and this is what I infer. There are only two voltages which can be used for an adaptor to produce up to a maximum of 20 Watts: 5V and 9V. 5 volts can be used for a current to produce between .5 watts and 15 watts. 9 volts can be used for a current to produce between 15.03 watts and 27 watts. I assume (although I could well be wrong) that Power Delivery (sans PPS) allows more than one option at a given voltage. So, for example, this adaptor could have been made to also allow the device being charged to ask for and get a comfortable 5 watts (and still have the options for 15 and 19.98 watts). (I downloaded the latest USB-PD specification and it's 870 pages, way too much to struggle through. Update: USB-PD added version 3.2 on about 10/30/23 and the spec is now 1,113 pages.)

Finally, let me go over the differences for the three remaining adaptors of the nine covered by the instruction pamphlet. I will only detail the differences from the 6 of 9 (which is therefore the default spec).

Model A2344

> Input 100-127V
> PD Output (for 5V, same watts as our default or) 9V @ 2A = 18 Watts
> Input 200-240V
> PD Output (same options as our default, 15 and 19.98 Watts)

Model A2465

> Input 100-110V
> PD Output (for 5V, same watts as our default or) 9V @ 2A = 18 Watts
> Input 110-240V
> PD Output (same options as our default, 15 and 19.98 Watts)

Model A2246

> Input 100-127V
> No Power Delivery Output! Only provides 5V @ 2.4A = 12 Watts
> Input 200-240V
> PD Output (same options as our default, 15 and 19.98 Watts)

Last addition: The EU (and India) made their USB-C and Power Delivery charging mandates for the next couple of years. They are not yet regulating wireless charging which is coming fast and in many instances can fully replace USB/wired. What's missing, at least for me, are manufacturers revealing the detail charging capabilities of their chargers, and especially of their devices. Hiding behind ""proprietary"" has become entirely an excuse.",1
"Apple with it's wisdom claims to not include a charger on the new iphone 12. to be green. Coming from a iphone 8, the charger will not adequately charge the 12. I wanted to buy aftermarket, which is less money. However, if for some reason the aftermarket one damages my phone, will Apple cover it under wrrty? Perhaps not. So I felt compelled to buy Apple brand. Once it is out of wrrty, then aftermarket is for me. Apple could have included a voucher to come to a store or nearby retailer and receive a power adapter. This trillion dollar company should have included the adapter with the phone in some form or fashion. You spend $800 for a phone and then you have to get your own charger. Shame on them.",1
"This power adapter is fine and works as expected. I'm just pissed off I have to spend $20 for something that should have been in the damn box with my new iPhone 12 pro. So stupid, thanks Apple!",1
"Even though the text claims these adapters put out 20w for a fast charge, they do not. my iPhone 15 pro cycles the power on and off using this adapter and the 10ft cord. The thing that fixed it was purchasing a Apple branded 20w adapter.

Mind you, the cables are also temperamental. Using my MacBook apple supplied adapter with one of them requires several tries to get the power to connect. Not so with the apple supplied 6ft cord. I would not recommend these in spite of the MFi Certification.",1
"Originally order and after the delivery date was changed never received. Amazon driver did try to deliver what I assume was the order. The video showed him trying to take a pic of the delivery only to appear frustrated he could not complete. After wait period had them ship replacement order. It arrived today with one MagSafe charger clearly an open box return. The other was clearly new. Not your best look Amazon. Tested and it appears to work. Pay for new receive open box.",1
"I bought this to charge my iPhone 13 and 14. While it worked good at first, I noticed that it was taking longer to charge as time went by. Today, I started charging my iPhone 14, then had to charge my iPhone 13. I noticed when I took the iPhone 14 off the charger, it was very warm. It had been charging for about 15 mintes. When I plugged in the iPhone 13, I had to move it after a few minutes. That's when I noticed the phone and charger were very hot so I unplugged the phone and removed the charger from the plug. I plugged in my old charger and it's been about 20 minutes and neither that charger or my phone are hot. I no longer feel this charger is safe. What a waste!",1
"This was my first time buying an apple product from amazon. And it will be my last. My charger has stopped working after like 2 weeks and now it has to be angled in a certain way to charge. Don’t buy apple products from amazon just buy it from the apple store.",1
"Bought the charging block just over a month ago and it stopped working. It’s of course barley outside of the return window and Amazon will do nothing to help with the defective product. Now I have to go through Apple to see if they will replace it. I understand return windows and I understand warranties. Nonetheless, a product should not be non-functional after just over a month. Really disappointed in this product and Amazon. Save yourself some trouble and purchase directly through Apple.",1
"It worked great at first.... but it's been less than I month since I purchase it and it already stopped working. This morning I woke up to find my watch never charged last night. I tried various outlets and at first thought the cord was the problem. Turns out it's the wall adapter. I am always sure to buy apple products for charging products since they typically last.... Disappointed it stopped working so quickly!",1
"Apple makes quality products, but at twice the price of other usb-c charging adapters out there, you would think a wire could be included with these adapters. Sure one comes with the phone, but that’s not the point. The extra wire allows charging elsewhere such as in the car or connecting to a MacBook.",1
"I don’t think it’s legit , my phone dies very quickly. Comes with all apple info. I put my phone to charge at 10% at 6 am it’s 6:50 am and it charged 80% took it off due to me having to take the kids to school. The weight hmm idk about that seems a little off.",3
"It charges fast, but sticks out too far from the wall behind my cabinet unfortunately. I had to order a different brand to get a flat wall profile.",3
"Why would Apple think I would want a plug in without a cord?",3
"You can’t plug in a usb cab egg l to charge your phone",3

If I have any problems, I will update my post.",3
"I use a number of Apple items. With Apple starting to make their products in the USB-C format, I naturally wanted to have a 20watt charger as Apple claims this charger could charge their items quickly.

I used it to charge the Watch, and the AirPod Pro. But I found that this charger was no faster than the use-c charger from the MacAir. So I returned it. Disappointed.☹️",3
"I ordered three and paid for brand new price. Received a used one (other two were fine). The box is clearly repackaged and at first I thought it was maybe returned because the original purchaser bought the wrong one and realized after opening. However, the brick’s protective wrap was removed and scratches are visible indicating it is used.",3
"This item was advertised as part of a package deal. Shouldn't assume that all items will work together though because they will not and then you can't return the power adaptor because it's considered hazardous material.",3
"Apple as usual is good with there electronics asking as you treat it like you would treat others with kindness. Although it’s big and fits certain spaces I would suggest other charging blocks to help with tight spaces and easy fixes.",4
"I got this to go with my magsafe charger, and when it arrived I noticed that it looked kind of different from a 20W Apple charger adapter I already had which came with my ipad. I figured out eventually that the only difference is that this one is made in India. After a couple of months I can’t tell the difference really between this one and the original one made in China.

It seems to be a legit Apple product, and has been working perfectly for over two months, but 4 stars because it’s kind of sketchy at the end of the day. Why is it being sold in the US, when US apple stores don't stock these?",4
"Got it to have a spare. It works. Not sure if its charging power is better than any other.",4
"The only charger that reliably charges me iPhone 13 Pro in record time (thus far, in my home).

20W output can charge my iPhone from red to full in, like, what, 30 minutes or less? It's just pretty damn fast compared to the old 5W days. So performance wise, absolutely no problem. Perfect.

The design also looks nice. However, it's much bigger than the familiar 5W ones. If they can somehow pack 20W power into a 5W size, it'll be even better. Easier to travel with for sure! Until then, this will do.

Interestingly enough, to date, I have not bought a 3rd party 20W charger to compare performance, because since each of these Apple official ones are only $20, it isn't really breaking the bank, so I just kept buying the Apple versions.

Tbh, that's already somewhat pushing the price ceiling. They only give you the charger, not even cable. Apple's a cheapskate. That's why it got a 4-star rating instead of 5. For pricing.

(But I expect to test some off brand ones soon. Let's see if they work just as well, finally.)

As to my already owned Apple chargers at home, I ONLY buy them when it's around $20, never more. Anything more, you're REALLY overpaying.

But lately, they've been going on sale for around $15. I heard, it's because they are finally ditching the lightning cable. Everything will switch to USB-C, and these will become obsolete. Aw well, more discount for me. I will be using my iPhone 13 for a while.",4

"I’ll try to keep this short and to the point.

I purchased the Ultra Watch 2 and because of the price of the watch, I was terrified to get it scratched. Therefore, I wanted to get something to prevent getting scratches on it.

Of course, I went to Amazon and there were (still are) a lot of different products, which appear as though they will do the job. To help me narrow down which one I was going to purchase, I decided to look at the reviews. And when I looked at the reviews for this product, there were a lot of very positive ratings and comments by buyers. Therefore I made the decision to go with this product.

From the moment that I opened the padded envelope, there were already problems. I bought the package which had two watch cases. In my situation, one was clear and one was blue.

For the blue one, I could already see scratches along the inside edges of the screen. Therefore I decided to go with the clear one, but I kept the blue one around just in case.

I applied the clear case to my watch and anticipated that would be the end of things. But I was wrong.

A few days later, while at work, in front of the computer, I noticed that there were big splotches, which appeared to be underneath the screen of the case. And as a result of the splotches, I wasn’t able to press down on some of the areas on the screen of the watch. For example, I wasn’t able to press the numbers in my passcode correctly to even open the watch because of the splotches.

I hadn’t taken a shower with the watch, nor had I gone swimming with the watch. I had just worn the watch for a few days under normal conditions. The splotches should not have been there.

But I remember reading that if moisture develops under the case of the watch, you were supposed to take the cover off, remove the splotches, and then put the case back on the watch. Sounds simple, right?

Absolutely not! Since I was worried about scratching the watch, I decided against using a screwdriver or a hammer or anything else that could possibly scratch it.

I mean, how difficult could it be to take this plastic off my watch? Extremely difficult! It took me approximately an hour to get that case off without scratching it. My fingers were practically destroyed in the process (maybe that’s a slight exaggeration, but they were definitely very sore). That was a nightmare!

I wanted to reach out to the manufacturer, but I can’t find their contact information anywhere! It may be somewhere easy to find, but I haven’t found it. And that makes it even more frustrating. I wanted to write to them first rather than my first course of action being a review, but since I can’t find a way to contact them, I have no choice but to leave a review.

If they contact me and try to make things right, I will change my rating and update my review here. But until that happens, I am going to leave a very low rating and this not so great review. I mean, I think it was written ok but the review doesn’t support purchasing these cases.

I apologize for the length of this review. And I hope this review helps someone!",1
"When I first ordered this apple watch case, from this specific listing, it was a great case that allowed for the entire functionality of the watch (without getting in the way of its buttons / turn-dial / etc). Now it’s not the same product, so I am really a bit frustrated about this. It took me one day of wearing it to realize that the dial on the side of the watch (which allows for moving between written letters / characters, or unlocking the watch when it is on sleep mode), to realize that the side-dial is just short of absolutely impossible to turn with any accuracy or precision — let alone, without pressing it in and completely backing out of what was being written. I can no longer easily unlock my watch from sleep mode because I can’t turn the dial, since the case is blocking the area for such.

This product listing used to be for a different case fitting — (which I bought twice, because it was super seamless with regard to the functionality of the watch, making it easy to forget the case was even on it) — as now, the third time I purchased this product, it is clearly a differently-fitted case. I cannot stand trying to text with my watch with the (undisclosed) new type of case that they are sending when purchasing from this product page. Whereas all was perfect with the molding / shape / fit of the case they used to send when purchasing this product, which i must admit…is very scammy of them to do.

Since the item being sent changed, but the product listing remains unchanged, anyone looking at this product might as well disregard any of the countless positive reviews for it, since they dont apply to the current product being sent. These reviews are all reviewing a different style that was being sent until about a month ago, when the product being sent out has changed. The reviews are for the product listed, but not the product currently being sent out.

The positive reviews are for an item that isnt any longer being sent. The positive reviews are for the style that they had always consistently been sending out, when we purchased from from this product listing — one that allowed for easy usage of the watch's user interface (namely free ease of usage for the dial on the side).

Now they are deceptively (illegally) sending out a product that is entirely different, and they are managing to fool the customers now, by using the reviews for the old style (sent up until a month or so ago, and for a LONG TIME), when sending out an entirely different (massively frustrating) type of watch case (one that doesn't allow the user to use the most basic function on the outside of the apple watch — the turn dial on the right side of the watch).

Do not buy.

This is deceptive marketing.

All reviews you see are for a version that worked — not the current one they decided to start sending out without notice.

Buyer be warned.",1
"I had to remove this cover within a day of using it for the following reasons, some are the same reasons mentioned in other negative reviews:

- Removal of the case is EXTREMELY difficult. Some other reviewers have had to take a screwdriver to get the case off of the watch. I will recommend using a wooden skewer or a plastic object to pry the case off. The case does not come with any instructions whatsoever so there are no tips or tricks to easily remove it. Trust me you'll be scared off damaging your watch when you attempt to take case off.
- For as securely as it clamps around the watch you would think that the screen protector would be sealed against the screen but it does not. This results in a bubble forming between shell and the screen to the point that it does not register any touch operations. I noticed this happening within a day of installation and especially after a 30 mins workout. I think warm weather and workouts can make it warp and deform to cause it not to seal properly around the screen.
- Because of the bulky nature of the case it is tricky to work with the digital crown and the button alongside it. I found it very tricky to scroll with the digital crown. Additionally the case would cause accidental clicks of the button on the same side as the crown, once it almost resulted in an emergency call.",1
"Recently got an Apple watch series 9 and needed a good screen protector to go with it. I got this one and decided to give it a go. As for durability it is very much just ok and will crack if you hit something whereas in my experience some more high-quality brands would be able to withstand the pressure. My biggest issue comes with the water protection. Just by simply washing my hands there would be water all over the screen and although it is really easy for water to go in, it is not easy for it to come out. I would have small patches of water all over the screen protector and after every time I washed my hands I would have to take it off and clean the screen protector before putting it back on. Ended up just throwing it away just because of how infuriating it got to be.",1
"I see a lot of great reviews for this product on previous watch models, but this might not be the best choice if you have a Series 9 Watch.
I genuinely don’t know if the tempered screen is supposed to “stick” to the watch face like a plain screen protector or if it’s supposed to be lifted off of the surface like it almost always is. This doesn’t hamper functionality UNTIL YOU DO ANYTHING INVOLVING MOISTURE.
This case attracts water to it like nothing I’ve ever seen before, and once it gets moisture inside it traps it underneath the case and lets it sit until you take it off and wipe the underside.
I honestly believe this case is WORSE for your watch than it is better because of this, and god knows how long it will take to inevitably destroy the damn thing because it’s trying to drown it.
I ended up getting just a plain screen protector from Zagg to protect my watch, and I highly recommend other folks with an Apple Watch Series 9 to do the same and avoid this product.",1
"This product lasted less than a week. Apple Watches are water resistant. This cover is NOT. With proper placement (used the wipes to include the wet and dry for placement) then regular use (no swimming, submerging of watch), this product has condensation under the screen in less than a week. It has now been trashed. This is actually the first time I’ve had any issues with a watch cover for Apple Watches. I only replaced my last cover bc of a fall that thankfully the cover saved my watch completely. I couldn’t find the brand of my last watch cover so tried this. Really disappointed that within a week this failed (added bonus is since I used the product, I cannot return it but also a risk you take so is what it is).",1
"I’ll keep this simple, I wanted to love this product but every time I wash my hands water manages to get into the case in between the screen causing a bubble making it hard to interact with the touch screen. I need to remove the case which I do it with my hands (not as hard as others claim), which make me think I have a cheaper version of the case. Anyway, I still keep it on because I don’t want to scratch my watch but I now push it back as far as I can on my wrist to wash my hands to prevent water from going in. Sucks but I don’t want to go through the whole trouble of driving to a drop off location to return. I will take the $10.00 as a lost. DON’T BUY.",1
"I’ve had two of these. Both cracked within 10 days of being installed on my series 9 Apple watch size 45. Now the first one I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt as I was doing a lot of work taking down Christmas lights, etc.
The second one that’s pictured looks to me like a pressure crack, as it was not exposed to anything that could have caused the crack. It’s like the pressure just from being on the watch caused it as it must expand a little to fit over the case, or perhaps the pressure from the band being on fairly tight could be the problem. I noticed they now have a newer version of this cover. But no explanation as to why.",1
"No instructions. I didn’t think much of it bc it seemed pretty straight forward. First use the moist towelette to clean screen, dry with the dry towelette, remove backing from the protector, then snap it on my watch. Np. The first time I washed my hands after adding the protector to my watch, immediately there was water behind the screen portion of the protector. Unfortunately, when there’s water under the screen protector the screen can’t tell what you’re trying to touch at all. I decided to remove the first screen protector & try the second that came in the pack. Same thing. This watch/screen protector is useless for me. I wash my hands a lot & splash water around. I do actually touch my screen to use my watch for various things which I cannot do at all with this product on my watch. Complete waste on money.

I gave this company another try when I ordered the protector that literally says waterproof. The speechless emoji, that’s how I feel rn. I’ve had the “waterproof” screen protector on my watch half the day & already I see water around the edges of the screen protector. I’ll be sure to leave a review on that product too. SMH.",1
"I wish I read the reviews about this screen protector before purchasing. Although being inexpensive and aesthetically pleasing, this case is a nightmare. It collects moisture under the screen and render the watch useless as the screen becomes unresponsive to touch and taps. The case gets scuffed up and foggy, which made my brand new watch look a decade old. To add insult to injury, it took 30+ minutes to pry the protective case off of my watch, and I had to incorporate plastic forks and knives to get the case off! I will be returning and regretting the fact that I didn’t read other user’s experiences before purchasing. Will definitely be returning and not looking back!",1
"I’ll be the first to say I’m surprised by my overall dissatisfaction with the case. I was looking for something to just cover the screen of my watch, but I found very little on Amazon for a basic film screen protector. Reading reviews or search fatigue lead me to this screen protector.

If you’re looking for full watch protection and don’t mind sacrificing the overall feel of the watch, then this may be for you. This case felt awful for a few reasons.

(1) Apple and other companies have come a long way in making their products finger print resistant. Adding a case will inevitably detract from that feel. But I’ve found many of these tempered glass screen protectors lacking in this department. They thirst for my prints dripping from my oily fingers. No amount of shirt polishing, alchol wipes, or rotations of wax on/wax off rid this case of my prints/smudge.

(2) This is curious design to me. The case shrouds the crown, making it much harder to use. The crown almost sits flush with the case, so it’s hard to discern where the crown is at times. I can no longer use my thumb and finger to scroll the wheel. Odd decision here.

(3) There is this dot matrix on the protector that I assume to be to help with glare, but the dots are just incredibly invasive when looking at certain angles. Sure that’s a bit dramatic. But jump out and scare me at night. For the first few hours, I thought I’d forget to remove some tape or a sticker. Even while writing this review, I took the case off to see if I had indeed missed something, and I do not believe I have. Another ass choice, but this one has merits.

This case will help many from breaking or damaging their Apple Watch, but it made me want to break mine. The bulk of this case is hard to overcome given how nice the watch feels by itself. But the screen requires protection. I’ve scratched far too many fitbits to not know better. This solution simply didn’t work for me.",2
"It’s only been about a week so far I’ll update if it breaks or anything drastic within the couple months. Great protection! Some things I have noticed however: It’s a little tricky to put on and seems like it’d ruin the watch(it hasn’t) but that’s kind of the point of it to stay on tightly. I’ve had to take it off to wipe the water I got in from washing my hands just once so far. But the water stays in there until you do that. I’ve dropped the watch once with this on about three feet onto carpet, it didn’t scratch I don’t think it hit anything though. The back of the watch that presses on the wrist however, the screen protector’s sides sticks out a little from the watch’s own case (sensors still stick out further though which is good) and causes some discomfort on my wrist, and leaving light indent lines on my skin from it. Pressing the screen is a little tricky but it’s doable. Overall, I think it’s worth it so far to protect the screen. Everything else are just little things to watch out for.

Update: Minus 2 stars. Almost a month since writing the review. I don’t use these anymore, but will do so if I do something that needs a protector on this. It got too annoying with water and dust getting between the cover and screen and having to remove, put back on. I figured with the series 9, the screens are made durable enough so I don’t need to use this every day. I’ll have them around for backup if I need. Really wasn’t worth the purchase.",2
"Apple Watch 9, 41mm, followed instructions (not included in kit - have to look online), ""wet-cleaned"", then ""dry-cleaned"" with provided cleaning pads, then remove back seal from cover, carefully place cover over stem side and then click it down into place. Pressed down hard on new cover to adhere tightly to watch screen. Looked good. Took shower next day with watch on my wrist - one corner now looks like it is not adhering and that spot is growing with the day. Is it water? I do not know. It will not ""re-stick"" back to the watch screen and now it has a blotch. It could have been a good idea if their cover actually tightly stuck to the watch screen. Now I have to find a cover that actually works.",2
"At first it worked good, made the watch look bigger and definitely gave it more protection with side covers. After some time it develops a gap in between the watch screen and the protector which basically disables the touch screen. I could not even enter my pass code to get in the watch. I removed the protector and cleaned it from moisture and put it back on. With in hours it did the same thing. There are two pieces in the package so I will try the second one and will let you know how that goes... Number two did the same thing but faster. After it was installed for several hours started to show separation from the screen, see pictures. I removed it again and found moisture/water droplets, its not sweat I'm in north east and its November. I realized the only time it would be exposed to water is when I washed my hands. Which means dust will get in there also. After water gets in between the screen protector and the watch some parts of the watch screen will not respond to your touch. I do not recommend. I ordered regular tempered glass for the watch, which will stick to the screen but only protects the screen and not the sides of the watch. I do not recommend this product.",2
"I bought this product looking for an apple watch cover that was glass. Most of the apple watch ultra covers I looked at had been tempered glass (unlike other apple watch covers that had been scratch protectors). I got this one seeing the number of reviews but upon putting it on my apple watch, it quickly (over the course of a day) lost it's adhesive to my screen it seemed. I tried touching certain areas of my apple watch screen and some areas were more sensitive than others. Some areas allowed for a response upon touching and some didn't even allow me to swipe. I thought I had touched the inside of the screen protector (the part that touches the screen) too much and so I discounted it as a dud. I tried the second one that came in the box and again, over the course of the day, it seemed that the touch sensitivity didn't allow me to touch parts of the screen. Almost like a bubble. The protector was on all the way (it couldn't get pushed further down towards the screen) and so I had to take it off and just went with regular tempered glass. I'm not sure there was anything wrong with the glass, just that the glass did not always touch the screen making it less responsive to touch, sometimes forcing me to sit there for a minute to press something on the screen.",2
"I originally liked the protective cover because it offer full protection, but as I've noticed air keeps getting inside and it sometimes makes my screen murky (I'd upload a video but I don't want Amazon access to my photos-nunya biznizz Amazon!) which makes it impossible to actually use my watch. The buttons are inoperable with this cover unless I take it off and clean it and reattach. Cumbersome. And within a few days the bubbles come back and the murkiness and I'm back to not being able to use my watch. SMH. But it does protect the watch face from getting cracked, so there's that.",2
"I didn’t return because I would rather have this on my watch than nothing at all. However it rattles while on the watch. When I click the screen or even move my wrist in a quicker pace. I can hear the rattle. When I was washing my hands I quickly just stuck my wrist under the water and what little water did get under the screen stayed there until I took off the product. It is not easy to take off I was worried I was going to either break the crown off of my watch or break this product in itself. So it is FALSE. It is NOT WATERPROOF at all. Does not do good in or around water. When a little bit of water droplets got under it I couldn’t even touch my screen anymore it would not work.",2
"Misxi 2 Pack Hard PC Case : I like it and highly recommend it. fits extremely well on my 41 mm red w rubber straps. I've already bumped into walls door counters etc and although not hard hit it enough that I check my watch and no scratches on either the actual iWatch or this protector. no issues w button wheel or sensitivity on screen. everything works well no hiccups for me. I also looked at the Spigen one but I like how this one has an empty back so the watch is directly on your wrist. personal preference here but I like that opposed to the Spigen that covers some of the back as well.

the only issue I have which is a personal one, nothing to do with the quality or functionality of the case is, I can't seem to find a way to wash my watch without water getting into it. when a lot of water gets into it the touchscreen doesnt work; you can see bubbles and pressing down does nothing. I need to remove the case and dry it. washing your hands is perfectly fine, I'm talking after a long run or gym session I usually take my watch off and wash the sweat and chalk from my watch. thats not going to work anymore as water gets stuck between the case and the watch. I've also tried holding the watch in one hand while soaping the other and gently washing the watch making sure it's not under the faucet and that also doesnt work for me. using a sponge or towel has worked which is fine, I guess I'm just used to running it under the sink. again. not a defect in any means and I still give it 5 stars.

Update Sept 2022
Dropping to two stars:

Mine was pretty solid until recently. Maybe the weather is so humid but short run and absolutely fogged up and cannot use the watch. Touch screen doesn't work when it fogs up as it causes a layer of condensation. Ok maybe it's the run. Short walk to the office and also fogged up and touchscreen stopped. Literally walking from the train 6 blocks to the office.

Very disappointed with the life of this product - this Pic is going a few blocks to grab lunch. You can see there is now a condensation bubble - when that happens the touchscreen is useless",2
"Great fitting protector BUT if you plan to sweat or swim or wash your car while wearing it, it’s a problem. Moisture got under the first one I put on when I played sports and sweated profusely. I assumed that it could be one that did not seal well or that maybe I installed it incorrectly. So I removed it and installed the second one, since it comes in a 2-pack. I washed my car while wearing the watch, moisture got in again. It takes nearly 48 hours to dry out and during that time the screen is mostly unresponsive - frustrating! So this Ultra 2 watch face cover is a definite no for me or anyone else that plans to use the Ultra 2 for what it is intended - more extreme conditions!",2
"At first glance, the item that’s great. I put it on my Apple Watch Ultra after cleaning it, and making sure there was no dust, as I am meticulous about that. Then I keep noticing that there was a smudge that wouldn’t come off. I thought maybe I just hadn’t cleaned it correctly. So I cleaned it 3 times, then 4 times, then 5 and noticed that the smudge will not come off. Once I examined it with a really high powered light, I realize that it was not a smoke at all, but a scratch, as if something abrasive had rubbed on the inside of the cover.

Once I placed it against the darker surface and put a light on it, I can see that it was nothing I could do to remove that. It came defective from the factory very disappointed because it’s a very good product otherwise except in the rain. It is a very poor job of keeping water off and actually traps the water inside.

I really wouldn’t bother me anyway because I didn’t buy this to be waterproof. I just wanted to at least be something that was perfect upon arrival and have no smudges on it. Really would appreciate if they sent me a replacement that actually doesn’t have the scratch?.

Be careful with these products. It’s hit and miss. And this time I guess I missed. *shrugs*",2
"I got a two-pack, which was good because the first protector screen had a scuff or smudge that would not clean off. It was pretty minor, and a typical person may not have minded or even noticed. Luckily the second protector screen was better. Still could detect very minute scratches/streaks, but only staring at it carefully with the light at just the right angle. Fit-up was excellent and installation was easy. Touch screen, side buttons and digital crown all work flawlessly. Note: this was the second two-pack I ordered. The first order was shipped (supposedly), but never arrived, so I had to ask for a refund after a week of waiting and reorder the product. This left my watch unprotected for over a week. The second order arrived in two days.
UPDATE 01/31/2024: Major Flaw. Today I got my Apple Watch Ultra 2 wet with the protector installed. Water gets between the screen protector and the watch screen. The only way to get the water out is to remove the protector and dry everything out and then reinstall the protector. The protector is not that easy to remove. Takes some effort. This is not a ritual anyone wants to do every time your Apple Watch gets wet. I will be looking for a different watch protector. Disappointed.",3
"I had one of these on my watch for about a month and bumped it on the edge of my granite countertops and it split right down the middle of the glass. It wasn't a hard bump so I thought I hit it just right that it caused it to break like that. I swapped it out for the second one that comes in the box and about a week later I bumped it again on the edge of my work desk, which is probably MDF wrapped in vinyl and I got a small crack at the top. Very small, almost looks like a small hair stuck to it. I just can't believe that this is tempered glass like the description says. Maybe these hits were just bad luck, and the angle and the pressure were just right, despite they weren't hard hits, causing them to crack. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they saved my watch from the same fate and give them 3 stars, but I would assume these should stand up to more abuse.",3
"I got this cover to protect my Apple Watch as I am a bit clumsy. The product looked really nice when I opened it. It felt sturdy and I think it has done a great job protecting my watch so far (it’s been about a week). The glass feels solid and I like that the plastic portion curves around to protect more than just the screen. My only complaint is that the matte color of the plastic around the screen is peeling off slowly revealing a shiny black part underneath. I prefer the matte look and I don’t think it’s supposed to peel like that. Haven’t showered with the watch on, only washed my hands so I wouldn’t say excessive exposure to water. I’ve been trying to be careful with the watch, even with the protector on so a bit disappointed with the wear of the case.",3
"Don't get me wrong it is nice but the issue I have with it is if the watch gets wet (etc. shower, swimming, faucet...haven't experienced it in the rain since my watch is under a sleeve.) the water gets between the watch face and the cover meaning one has to take the cover off, dry both the watch and cover off, then reinstall. not a big issue but if you swim a couple of times a week it gets obnoxious.",3
"Super easy to put on, not bulky and had a nice look to it. My only issue is that from day one there was this bubble on the screen but it was not that big of a deal for me. Then it came off once at the gym and since then it would get sweat inside the screen or something so i had to take it off and wipe it and then i just threw it away.",3
"Of the two that arrived, one of them was broken. It was the blue one, which I really wanted to use. The touch screen worked great. The sensitivity was not reduced at all. One thing which bothered me; when exercising, it appeared my sweat was accumulating below the plastic cover. This caused me to switch to another product which protects the screen only.",3
"Quite sleek and not too noticeable on watch, haven’t bumped into anything but feels like it provides good protection. Would rate higher but during a somewhat heavy workout moisture gut under the protector and not coming out. Is 2 pack and will swap and hopefully 2nd won’t have the same issue.",3
"These fit my watch perfectly but, they crack very easily. I’ve been wearing this one for two days and it’s already cracked. I also notice condensation stays between the actual watch face and the protector any time I work out or if my watch is in the bathroom when I shower.",3
"The screen protector does great at protecting the watch. My only negative is that in the shower it gets condensation/water between the watch and the screen protector. There is constantly a water ring around the screen protector unless I take it off after every shower and dry it off.",3
"Love the protector, only complaint is that the screen has a bunch of small dots on it that are visible at most angles. I though they would wipe off since it seems like it was due to the protective film that was over it, but they didnt",3
"Fits the series 9 well and looks good. Hope the tempered glass holds up well. The only drawback to this design is the open back allows water/moisture to get under it and reduce touch screen function. Easily fixed by removing and wipe dry. Good overall protection.",4
"I like the cover a lot and how easily it snaps on the watch. My only complaint is the moisture that gets in every time I wash my hands or handle something wet, you can see the bubbles on the edge of the watch screen. I pretty much have to take the cover off to dry off the moisture every time I get my hands wet, or take my watch off to avoid that from happening. Other than that it fits great and matches my watch nicely.",4
"Ordered this for my daughter who broke her watch screen. Once she got it repaired she ordered this but told me it was very hard for her to use her watch. Touching the screen has to be touched with much greater force and water constantly gets under it from her washing her hands. (I saw this in several reviews and thought people were swimming with it. Once she showed me how water got under it, it was very understandable why a lot of reviews said the same thing.) Wish there was a better way for water to not get under it so easily.",4
"I just opened this to put it on my watch and the wet wipe was dry. I’ve purchased this in the past and not had a problem. Also, as a note to others, water seeps into the case when swimming or showering and makes it almost impossible to use the touch screen unless you remove the case and dry the watch face and inside of the protector. Other than that it works perfectly. Obviously I don’t have a problem with that as I bought it again.",4
"Glass is scratch resistant and holds up well. Crown is hard to use. Some edges are hard to get to work well.

Overall, I recommend wearing the Apple watch without a screen protector for a better experience, but I totally understand why someone wouldn’t.

I now use mine without and prefer it more. These screen protectors are sufficient.",4
"If you take a shower or wash your hands, be careful not to get water on the case. Definitely not for swimmers or people who get their watch wet. Other than that it is the nicest case I’ve ever gotten for a watch. Screen is beautiful and so is the case. Worth it if you don’t plan on getting it wet or I’d give this case 6 stars",4
"They advertise that the case will fit the series 9 Apple Watch but it does not. The case is 43MM and the series 9 is 41MM. Seems like a solid product and easy to install but you have to have the right size.",4
"Worked great for a couple of weeks and then the screen started looking scratched and after three weeks my icons were no longer clickable. I thought it was my watch, so I did a hard reset, which didn’t work because it’s this screen protector. I removed the screen protector and put it back on and everything is fine for now. The reason I bought this brand is because it had thousands of great reviews. Possibly moisture got under the protector. I’m going to try the second protector I received and be more careful around water. I’m also going to try a different brand. So, until I figure this out, I’m giving 3 stars for now.
Update
I did find moisture under the screen protector which caused the icons to be unresponsive to touch. I now take off my watch when washing dishes. No further issues, but it does get scratched up a lot faster than my iPhone screen protector. I know, because I’m wearing my watch and not my iPhone.
Increase to 4 stars.",4
"I really like how easy it is to put on and remove. Plus gives your watch all around protection. The only downfall is that when you get your watch wet, you have to remove the protector and drive the inside/watch.",4
"I work out 4-5 times a week and sit in the sauna most times. I have noticed that there is a little condensation buildup around the corners of the protector; however, it does mostly go away on its own.",4
"As a proud owner of an Apple Watch Series 6, I understand the importance of keeping my device safe from scratches, bumps, and everyday wear and tear. That's why I couldn't be happier with the Misxi 2-Pack Hard PC Case with Tempered Glass Screen Protector.

First and foremost, let's talk about protection.

"* Updated Review:

This screen protector protected my Apple Watch after my Apple Watch inadvertently fell off my hand onto a concrete floor as I was putting it on, a space of about 3 feet. Glass of screen protector cracked but my Apple Watch was left intact with no scratches or cracks at all. I have attached a picture of the aftermath showing the damage to the screen protector and the unscathed Apple Watch. I used the second screen protector that came with the package and will order a new package so that I can have a screen protector handy in case of an accident. Worth every penny and then some! Highly recommended!

Original Review:
⁃ I ordered this for the Apple Watch 6, 44mm with the space gray aluminum case and black sport band. The Apple Watch 6 has the same physical dimensions as the Apple Watch 5. I wanted to protect the Apple Watch 6 from the get go and applied the screen protector immediately the watch was delivered.
⁃ It’s almost a perfect match with my Apple Watch 6 Space Gray Aluminum case with black sports band. The black sports band color almost matches the black color of the screen protector.
⁃ There are 2 pieces of the protective cover screen protectors in the box. That’s awesome as you can always have the extra one on standby in case you damage the first one and/or if you want to change the one on the Apple Watch.
⁃ They also have 4 pieces in total, of wipes for cleaning the face of the Apple Watch before applying the screen protector, 2 pieces of wet wipes and 2 pieces of dry wipes. You use one wet and dry piece for each application of the screen protector, making sure that the face of the Apple Watch is clean as it will mate with/rest on the surface of the screen protector. The wipes work perfectly in cleaning the face of the watch and they leave no smudges/fingerprints at all.
⁃ The screen protector comes with 2 stickers, one on each side of the glass surface. I removed the inner sticker just before applying the screen protector.
⁃ It’s easy to apply. Just make sure that the Apple Watch Digital Crown (big home button on top right of Apple Watch) fits in the slot of the screen protector.
⁃ The 2 surfaces, Apple Watch face and inner glass surface of the screen protector, mate perfectly and there are no bubbles or spaces between them. It’s almost impossible to know that the watch has a screen protector.
⁃ I applied the screen protector before inserting the straps just to make it easier for me. The straps have an unfettered access to the watch itself and you can slide the straps in and out easily, sliding out after pressing the buttons at the back and middle top and bottom of the Apple Watch. It works well and allows both the medium/large strap and the extra large strap to slide in and out.
⁃ Charging the Apple Watch is also perfect with this screen cover as it doesn’t cover the charging area of the Apple Watch.
⁃ I then removed the outer sticker of the glass screen protector.
⁃ If you have used an excellent tempered glass screen protector on a smartphone, this would be the equivalent for a smartwatch. After a while, you forget it’s there!
⁃ For the price, considering the fact that it’s a protector for quite an expensive smartwatch, it’s a very small investment.
⁃ The manufacturer/seller claims that you shouldn’t use this screen protector if you intend to use the Apple Watch for swimming as water will be caught in the case. Something to think about if you are going to be using your Apple Watch while swimming, especially if you do it frequently.",5
"I found a pretty significant crack on the case today (I’ve had it for some time now) and I removed it when I got home fully expecting to see at least some damage to the watch itself. The watch was completely undamaged, just like new. I replaced the broken case with the second case included in the box. It keeps the watch safe and clean, is easy to remove at attach, doesn’t interfere with functionality, and doesn’t interfere with any watch bands. I couldn’t ask for a better case and I’ll definitely order another box to have on deck in case something happens.",5
"I ordered the black, and it's a very nice look. Installation couldn't be easier, placing the side on the crown side first then angling it over, only pressing on the case (not the screen), it clipped right on. The screen is perfectly functional, pleasantly surprised. A great value, I haven't had it for long so I can't speak to it's durability, but glad I took a chance.",5

"I have been using the Misxi transparent case on my 45 mm Apple Watch 8 since it was new in December. It has provided great protection. I am not been too tough on my watch, but have occasionally hit it on walls or doors. The case has protected the watch without cracking or scratching after two months of use.

I've seen some reviews mentioning that water gets underneath the case. It is my understanding that the case isn't intended to be waterproof and only protects from scratches. I never submerge my watch in water and, therefore, have had no issues. If water got under the case, it is fairly easy to remove to allow for drying.",5
"I went online to check about the size of my watch and it said 42mm. Kept thinking about how hundreds of thousands of ppl gave it great reviews and mine wouldn’t fit. Decided to go back online and double check and another site said check the back of the watch. Yep 45mm. Bought the right size and boom perfect fit. My mistake, changing my review to 5 stars. May bad.

I have a 3 series, 42mm iwatch and this won’t fit. Bought a different brand on Amazon before but cracked so figured I give these a shot. I tried several ways to try and get it on but it’s too tight. Afraid I might snap it or scratch my watch. The label clearly says 42mm so I don’t know what the deal is. Had my bf try it and he said it’s too small, won’t fit.",5
"I was at the gym today when I lost my balance with 135lbs on my shoulders. I smashed my watch into the bar hook shattering the tempted glass and with the force I thought my watch too. NOPE! My watch was perfectly fine and didn’t even have a scratch on it. The glass case had a hole in it and that’s why I thought my watch was totaled. This product saved my watch and a painful call to Apple care. The nice part is I came home and install the second one that it came with, so it’s fully protected again. So, I have just brought another pack, because, well I’m a clumsy Mfer lol.",5
"I first bought these a couple of years back when I first bought my second Apple watch and now I can't imagine not having one on my watch. I got them for my parents and they like them too. I originally bought it because I didn't want my new watch getting beat up/scratched like my first watch did. While doing laundry I have bumped my watch so many times and this helps save it from scratching and getting beat up. I have replaced them a few times to try out different colors, and because after a while they get a little scratched. But hey I would much rather this get beat up / scratched than my actual watch. They are super durable and easy to put on which is nice. It's also fun because you can try different colors and it changes the color of the watch you have (but the screen part is still clear so you can see). Will repurchase again when needed.",5
"I bought this for my new 9 series watch and wanted something to protect the face and sides. My old watch got pretty beat up from wearing it while working on the car or doing other jobs around the house. This case is excellent and does not add any bulk, and is barely noticeable. The screen protector takes a little sensitivity away from the touch screen and you have press a little harder but thats expected. Its easy to take on and off to clean or dry after getting wet or sweaty after working out.",5
"Disappointing…all of the playdoh in the eggs was dried out.",1
"Cool idea, but I guess the eggs don't keep the Play-Doh fresh. Every one of them was completely dried out fresh out of the box. My son was disappointed. I attempted to get my money back, but they want me to ship the dried up play-doh back that I've already tossed in the trash. Not worth the trouble.",1
"Play Video
The eggs themselves were fun for my daughter to hunt for but the play doh inside was hard and gross. There were maybe three eggs out of the whole set that were able to be played with but even those didn’t feel like real play doh consistency. At least half of the eggs had crystals all over the doh (I’m assuming salt crystals?) I uploaded a video showing me opening one of the eggs from the packaging with the crystals formed on it. Pretty disappointing that we bought a giant set of play doh for my daughter and now she only has the plastic eggs to show for it because the doh inside was defective.",1
"Opened for Christmas and its all dry & crystalized. Not worth it!",1
"Play Video
I bought these for an Easter egg hunt and so we only came home with 6 of them. But all of them were really difficult to play with since they were already dried up a considerable amount. One of them even had started crystallizing(see picture). I imagine the ones that other kids took home are the same and I feel bad for providing them for the hunt. I could have gotten a better product. Compared to the playdoh that we have bought previously and still play with they seem like a totally different product.",1
"we had two Easter egg hunts with these and other eggs that were filled I found out after the children got them home that all of them are dried out and couldn't be played with smh crappy product what a waste of money I can't return them the children took them home. You can't tell me the company doesn't know this.",1
"I bought these Playdough eggs for my students (1st grade) so we could have an egg hunt and they could play with the Playdough afterwards. When they opened their eggs, at least half of the eggs had dry, crumbly Playdough in them. It was really disappointing to spend that much money and not be able to enjoy the Playdough.",1
"This product looked good in the eggs and the colors were nice and bright, but it was clearly rather dry when our grandkids opened them Easter day. We just threw it all away after one use. Would not purchase again.",1
"Not sure how old is this playdoh, but is super hard, like when you leave them open BUT they are all perfectly seal which leads me to think they are really old. Only a few were soft.",1
"Product promoted as 24 Easter eggs filled with PlayDoh. Received 6 PlayDoh eggs, 4 eggs with a piece of paper for treasure hunt and 14 empty eggs.",1
"Play-Doh compound dry. The egg containers did not keep it air tight. Opened 6 out of 24 egg containers Christmas morning. Disappointing. Suggest only buying Play-Doh in the traditional air tight bucket containers.",2
"Kids were excited to play,then was disappointed when it was too dry to play with.",2
"Play doh was pretty dry and hard to work with.",2
"Was suppose to have 24 eggs but there was only 23. Hard to divide it equally between my grandkids when one is missing.",2
"I bought these for my daughter for Easter. I buy value packs of playdoh all the time -but this time, they were all drop dry/hard for my toddler to smoosh!! Sadness.",2

"Play doh was pretty dry once opened.",2
"Some were dried up",2
"This play dough is dry and can't be used .Just a water of money",3
"The eggs arrived to late for Easter so I was unable to use them for their indented purpose so the seller is likely in no hurry to ship however the product was good and no issues with the play-Doh or eggs and the packaging was also very good. I would recommend however allow plenty of time for shipping.",3
"Great idea but, half the play-doh was dried out when opened up.",3
"The play doh worked great when I first got it, but I got so many that we didn't use them all. I thought if I kept them in the eggs/sealed and in the box they came in, closed shut, surely they would be good still the next year. No. Other play doh that we had in regular play doh containers were still soft while the unopened eggs I purchased from this pack were hard and unusable. Very disappointing.
If you buy this set, make sure you use it all right away. Don't try to save unopened eggs, it will just harden and be unusable.",3
"These make great stuffers for Easter, BUT I was very disappointed at the color options. duplicate colors and even some that are just a slight shade off from the other (ex: purple is so light that i could pass as the pink in the kit). Also, I purchased a week before Easter using the PRIME option and my item came a day after Easter. It's quite annoying to get a message after the fact that it was going to be late. I decided to keep them in hopes that they will be good next easter",3
"for the one I got out as a bargaining chip for one of the hellcats, seemed consistent with the Play-doh brand, but since we didn’t get them on time to actually hide and forget how many and find later in the year, I’ll have to update my rating next Easter. Unlikely that the malleability will hold up, but it was a pretty heavy box, so fingers crossed! Here’s to hopping!

-rad dad",3
"I got these for Easter baskets and the school Easter egg hunt, and they worked well in theory. When we went to play with the play-doh it was a bit dry and crumbled. I put some water on them to help, but then the dye kinda got everywhere. So worked for convenience but not to actually play with.",3
"I bought these on an Amazon Treasure Truck deal. Perfect for Easter egg hunt with the grands. Sadly, they arrived after Easter. I'm saving them for next year, hoping the PlayDoh stays good.",3
"Not sure if it's the eggs not having a good seal but the playdoh was drier than regular playdoh. It crumbled very easily and was difficult to mold and shape. Very messy. Needs better packaging to keep it moister. Overall my toddler loved it because of the eggs it came in.",3
"The play doh in these eggs was pretty dried out. My son tried to use them in his play doh told and they were a little crumbly. Eggs were cute, colors were fun, just ended up in the trash pretty quickly.",3
"Only reason for 4 stars, not 5. Some of the eggs were dried out, unable to knead, had to throw 4 away",4
"It's just like any other Playdoh, but it comes in a plain white box and instead of in cups, it comes in eggs. The eggs are a difficult design, because it is much harder to get the Playdoh back into the container, when compared to a cup. Overall, it's great as an Easter gift and the price is in line with most Playdoh offers.",4
"I used these as part of an Easter egg hunt and they worked well for that. I was disappointed that a few of the colors were dry and crumbly. Otherwise my kids enjoyed them.",4
"I purchased this item twice for my toddler. The first package was wonderful. It came in variety of colors and was soft and easy to mold. The second package was more dry and difficult to shape. It also had fewer color options. I didn’t get any oranges, red or pink. I received mostly blue, black, yellow /neon color and it really was not as fun to use. I was disappointed. Loved the box it came in. Not sure if I would purchase it again because of the second purchase disappointment.",4
"Bought these for my 2 daughters for Easter 🐣 we hid them for their Easter egg hunt, instead of having to fill plastic eggs with candy. This was much easier and nicer",4
"They were cute and each kid got a few different colors to play with",4
"My girls got these for Easter and were so excited by them. What a great idea and a fun alternative to candy! The play-doh inside was a little dry, firm, and not real easy to use. We added a little water to make them usable.",4
"Awesome purchase",4
"Adorable, but kind of dry and hard to put back in the eggshells.",4
"Want an Easter Egg hunt to not be so sugar-driven, then these will do. My neighbor and I do an Easter Egg hunt for our kids. She did the candy ones, I did these. They were a hit! It's basically Playdoh in a plastic Easter egg. I threw them around our yards and the kids had fun. The best part is that I got them before the pandemic around February 2020 and we didn't do a hunt Spring of 2020. They stayed in my closet until Spring 2021 and they were just as good and fresh as any newly bought/opened Playdoh.",4
"No matter what, PlayDoh is fun! I loved it when Play-Doh did the small Halloween pots of doh, so it was fun to see these eggs for Easter. Opened a couple and they are fun! Nice feel and the two colors are great!! These will be a good alternative to candy at the Easter Egg hunt this year!",5
"I can't wait to hide these for Easter to try to do less sugar on holidays so this was a great option.",5

"Can’t go wrong with play-doh!!",5
"A gift for my great-granddaughters who love play dough and it was a great alternative to candy at Easter",5
"Missing 1. Got 23",5
"I was expecting these to have just a little bit of dough but each egg is equal to a large play dough container. They are super cute for Easter or goodie bags. Very easy to open for small hands.",5
"Because of medical reasons our boys are not able to have sugar so we were looking for an alternative to make Easter fun and enjoyable for them. I was delighted to find these eggs, because we really love Play-Doh! After reading some of the reviews I was concerned about the quality, but every egg we have opened is nice and soft and just as our normal Play-Doh package. Much to my surprise, each egg contains about as much Play-Doh as a normal little Play-Doh tub. Another thing I really love is that I have two boys and there are two eggs for every color. It is wonderful that I made one purchase and when we go to play with our Play-Doh each boy can have their own of each color. Lastly, we were all enthused to find that this bunch of Play-Doh had a couple colors that we have not been able to find otherwise. I would definitely purchase these again even if it were not for Easter",5
"My grandchildren hunted for them as part of their Easter egg hunt indoors. They love Play-Doh!",5
"Bought as a gift for my 11 yr old. Bullets don’t shoot but just fall out to the ground. Gun is waste of money as does not work. Complete disappointment.",1
"We bought one of these pieces of poo to have some fun terrorizing squirrels on our feeders. First off the slide you cock it with became stuck and it took much fooling around to get it to release. With that monumental task completed we loaded it up and gave it a shot. A shot was what didn't happen. The gel bullets fell out the muzzle, directly below the muzzle. That is when we could get the cocking slide unstuck.

I'm glad I caught a deal on it as it now resides in a landfill, wasn't worth the effort to add to our frustration. Don't waste your money on this joke of a product, expect much better from Hasbro.",1
"I really want to love this item. It’s such a fun concept. My son got the gel fire brand last year and it was good for about a day then the gel pellets started just falling out of it.

I was hopeful the nerf brand would be better. I purchased 4 of them, one for each kid. They are so disappointing! The gel bullet just fall out the front unless you are holding it just the right way when you cock it, then the shoot about 10 feet at a really slow rate. I should return them but I don’t want to hassle with it.",1
"I had read reviews…it was an expensive “toy” even read where it could potentially hurt alittle. That was perfect as I bought it to hush my 100 pound lab from barking - just a quick startle to get his attention as he started barking outside to redirect him so he would stop barking. This thing is ridiculous!! He couldn’t even feel it or see it…barely heard it but nothing loud enough to even get his attention. And I was fairly close …15 yards or so. Useless.",1
"Our family purchase Nerf items often and this is the first time we were not happy with a Nerf purchase. My son tried so many times to get this Nerf gun to work, what a waste of the gel ammo, all of it was wasted just to try to get this gun to work properly. Well in the end maybe this was a faulty gun, we will try a different model. We had to return this one.",1
"This Nerf gun is garbage. Don’t waste your money, it barely shoots a water bead out and sometimes multiple come out at the same time and they basically just fall out, they don’t go far like you’d shoot it.",1
"I got somebody else's return. Balls were still in it and it didn't come with anything but the hopper and blaster. It barely fires and breaks the balls in the barrel when it does. Generally terrible.",1
"The balls just fell out the tip and when it shot the balls exploded 10/10 don’t recommend poopy products don’t waist your time",1
"There is a flaw in the manufacturing of this item that doesn't allow it to be loaded. Don't waste your money on this one. It does not load at all.",1
"Wow, what a total piece. After expanding the dots you end up with a ziplock bag full of fish eggs, and when you go to shoot them, it spazms out 2 or 3 at a time and they go the same number of feet. Who ever came up with this idea at Nerf should be fired.",1
"Single shots are not accurate in loading chamber when pulling drawback handle. Good item for cheap gift or first time use of these type of guns",2
"half the time it doesnt shoot, when it does the bullet splits into half and shoots like at a time",2
"My grandson only got one use from it. It stop working",2
"Thought this would shoot far and it early gets gel ball out of it.",2
"More than half of the time I shoot the gun, nothing comes out.",2
"Don't waste your money. It is not as good as other gel guns. Not even close",2
"I tried priming it and bullets kept on falling out, then when I shot it no bullets came out",2
"Bought two of these.. while one worked perfectly fine the other won't shoot at all.",2
"trash",2
"The package came damaged. When I took it out of the box, I shot a couple times and it didn’t feed very well matter-of-fact sometimes it double or triple feeds and doesn’t fire properly and works kind of unreliable. I would not recommend buying from this seller, as I saw a bunch of the reviews and they’re a couple of negative reviews, saying their stuff is bad. I know the Nerf Pro Gelfire Legion should not be this crappy so this may have been damaged either by the seller or was damaged during shipment. but at least it works so whatever.
EDIT: I contacted the seller and they offered a replacement for free, so props to them for that",2
"The gun is cheaply made ( as most things these days) however it just spits the gel balls out which was very disappointing for our son who wanted to shoot targets.",3
"The quality of this gun is great....but the bullets are a mess. A
Especially if you don't have a proper place to mix them. And they run out much faster than nerf bullets.",3
"This one I’m not too impressed with. You have to wait for a couple hours for the gel bullets to get to size. When I went to shoot it more then one gel bullet fell out of the gun. Nothing like what I expected.",3
"Rapid fire usage isn't as easy to do as the instructions make it seem. It takes a lot to pull the priming handle back. Would not recommend for young kids. My son is 12 and is struggling with it. It's just an okay purchase. Wouldn't buy again and wouldn't recommend.",3
"It’s not rechargeable like most. And doesn’t specify in the product details. Most are rechargeable and semi automatic. This requires cocking it before every single shot",3
"Mine broke after 2 months",3
"We received the Gelfire Mythic over the holidays and enjoyed it so much that we went and ordered the Legion. While the Legion doesn't have a lithium polymer battery or pull-out stock to get excited about, it does feature the same gauge of build quality that should be expected from a Nerf product. The Legion is comfortable to hold and fire in a variety of different sized hands, but the spring loading mechanism can be difficult to engage for some, especially since the cocking lever feels like it could use more purchase to grab onto. Furthermore, the way the loading mechanism works makes it more susceptible to either non-firing or having the gel ammunition roll out of barrel. The overengineering that prevented as many misfiring instances in the Mythic just can't be found in the Legion. As such, loading the Legion requires some finesse: fully pull back the lever, but don't keep the lever back for too long, and keep the Legion as level to the ground throughout the whole cycle. Eventually the loading slide will jam. And that requires some fully grown heft to pull the slide back and release it to it's original location. There's a tiny window on the top rear of of Legion that fills with an orange plastic tab to let you know when the spring is engaged... if you find that helpful.

From my own testing, the Legion fires polymer rounds faster than the Mythic, but that somehow makes it more difficult to aim. Orb shoters usually come with large hoppers and tons of ammo because they typically make up for their lack of accuracy with volume and rapid fire. In other words, the stream of orbs leaving the barrel will lead you on target. However, since the Legion only fires once for every loading cycle, hitting a target feels more like a matter of chance. That said, I've gotten pretty good at hitting targets at distance with the Legion, provided I use the barrel that came with the Mythic.

Speaking of the Mythic's barrel, there's some online debate over what its effectual use actually is. Sure, it added some noise effect for the automatic fire of the Mythic, but I swear it helps with aiming. Regardless of my opinion, Hasbro are probably just as divided over how useful the barrel is, since it isn't included with the Legion, and I actually believe that's an unfortunate omission. To be clear, there's definitely a place to attach the barrel onto the Legion. Aside from a Mr Beast tie-in that I'll never purchase, it's difficult to gauge Hasbro's commitment to the ever expanding gel launcher landscape. An included barrel for the Legion would have, at the very least, shown that Hasbro had more confidence in the Gelfire line.

Since we're talking about what didn't come in the box, let's talk about what did. The safety glasses are miles better than anything that came with any of the other non-Hasbro orb shooters that I own. Again, Hasbro engineered the safety glasses with a variety of different head/face shapes and sizes in mind. The Legion also comes with a packet of hardened polymer orbs that took roughly 4 hours to fully rehydrate and expand. After rehydrating and rinsing the orbs (to prevent sticking and misfiring), they were hand-loaded into the Legion's fun little hopper. The Legion's hopper is the smallest gel orb hopper I've ever seen, but since the Legion doesn't rely on volume to hit targets, it makes sense to have as small a hopper as possible... one that doesn't obscure sight of the target. It's also worth noting that virtually all of the Legion's packaging was flattened and chucked into the cardboard recycling. Aside from tape and a few bags, everything was recyclable and took up very little space in the disposal bin.

I definitely went all in on the currently available Gelfire series as it's amusing to see Hasbro play catch up with a market that they ignored for as long as they did. That said, you can definitely tell that Hasbro have put a lot of engineering thought and consideration into their Gelfire releases, but the Legion is an odd recommendation--especially since the Mythic can be purchased on sale for just 20 dollars more. I personally prefer goofing around with the Legion and being the local deadeye who can knock Duxie cups off the coffee table at 20 paces, but my kids probably would have preferred another Mythic.",4
"I think it's a good gel blaster for younger kids and teens. The prime is nice. It has decent accuracy at a range of about 40-50 feet. The gel beads don’t hurt much because it doesn’t shoot as hard as other gel blasters, but this is good for folks who don’t want to get a welt using a stronger blaster. One issue is that it will double feed every few shots, causing the shot to be inaccurate. Blaster is well built and sturdy. A good buy when on sale.",4
"The blaster is just ok. The hopper is good and the blaster is light weight. Does not require a charge so no batteries. However that is where the good ends. It has to be cocked before shooting each shot. Does not have much power. Very underwhelming overall.",4
"Thought it would've been bigger BUT it's fine because I bought them to donate to toys for tots for the older kids.",4
"Nerf Gelfire Legion. Best thing about it is it comes with more than enough ammo to last way past the interest the kid will have in this thing. If you haven't done gel bead blasters before, I suggest putting in just enough ammo to cover a quarter coin and a half in a tall cup of water and let it soak for 4 hours. Make sure the beads are completely submerged all the way to the end for best results. Drain the water COMPLETELY before transferring the beads to the hopper. Twist the hopper on and you're ready to go. Although the small hopper ""only"" holds 130 rounds, let's be real: this is more than enough for a match or two since this is a single shot blaster. The weight and feel of the blaster is very good especially for late teen to adult hands. The main gripe is performance. Not only are the Gelfire blasters the bottom of the barrel when it comes to performance (low fps) but reliability too. Performance isn't that big a deal since that means it's safer for kids but reliability can be a make or break issue for some players; a bad design in the bottleneck area causes the beads to get stuck frequently there and whoever is using the blaster will need to give it a good shake once every several shots in order to keep shooting it. Ultimately, it's not enough to distract from the toy that much and it's a decent way to dip your (or someone else's) toes into the world of gel bead blasters.",4
"Great gift to get, has to be used outside",4
"It's difficult to aim, and aiming is much more needed for it being pump-action, but is still good fun to plink around. Plus the ammo is super cheap",4
"Kids have this one and the Mystic. They like the Mystic way better because it dispenses more quickly, but they have fun with both!",4
"Not enough to destroy, just enough to pinch.",4
"What he wanted",4
"It's really fun to use but I would recommend a few things. The first thing is that when you load and cock your blaster don't do it too fast. The reason I say this is because sometimes a little puff of air will push the gel orb out of the gun a little bit causing it to not fire correctly. The second thing is the slam fire mode is when you hold the trigger and pull back on the ""hammer"" and release it repeatedly. This mode fires more gel orbs at a time but makes it fire significantly less accurately so in my opinion I wouldn't use that mode since your ammo will also run out fast that way. The third thing I recommend is to use fairly warm water for the gel orbs which can easily speed up the soaking process to only 20 minutes, I would just say to make sure they have reached full size the orbs won't fire right if they're too small. Fourth and last, these orbs are nontoxic so dropping one in the house by accident isn't a big deal.",5
"It’s a fun fun you can use to shoot. A warning is like to give out is that it may hurt.

If you have dogs, and are concerned that your dogs will eat the need bullets, this is your solution. The orbees explode on contact and dogs don’t eat it.",5
"We got these for my son for Christmas. He is 10. We bought three of them one for him, one for his dad, and one for his friends that come over. And let me just say they have such a blast. They play for hours and hours with with these. Since we have had them, they’ve played with them nonstop and I have not experienced any jamming or any issues with the guns as other reviewers have stated they for us they all three work flawlessly. The ammo is extremely long lasting. We have so much of it and it stays pretty inflated so you can continue to play with your toy throughout the day or days.",5

I would think that the company would hold every component of its product output from each manufacturing location to the same high standards consumers have come to appreciate.",3
"This was great for my kids but some of the pieces were not stay in there place",3
"Nice size Lego set but the rabbit is creepy looking lol",3
"I couldn't put together the bird, there was prices missing",3
"Super cute love the different options but the box came a little damaged :(",3
"Was told she enjoyed putting it together. She is 8 yrs old and was able to do it her self.",4
"My grand daughter liked this, she's 6. It required the help of an adult to put it together, but she enjoyed working together and creating it.",4
"A gift that they liked.",4
"This was my Grandaughters birthday request even after Easter . She turned 8 and loved it.
Not for a Lego beginner without help.
Good experience for eye ,hand ,brain coordination",4
"This was a great add in to our kids Easter baskets.",4
"Cute set",4
"This is a good size piece. My grandson was able to get it together in a reasonable amount of time",4
"I bought this specifically to build the bird and my only complaint is that it doesn't allow you to build anything to go with it. It just says to give it 2 legos to act as food. You do have enough legos leftover to build the fish from the seal if you swap a 2 by 1 piece for 2 1 by 1s from the bird though if you wanted to have a fish. The little claws on the bird also pop off very easily and I recommend gluing them on if you are going to be displaying it or leaving them off if kids will play with it. My favorite part is that you actually put a heart piece into the animals chest.",4
"Falling apart sometimes, it is hard for kids to play with it, but really cute object for decorating shelf",4
"Received it earlier than expected and in excellent condition. Immediately opened it and assembled it. Assembly was easy and well explained in the instructions. The rabbit 🐇 is cute as heck and I'm thinking of purchasing another to make the bird. 🐦 I now have it displayed on a shelf representing my Chinese zodiac birth year. All in all, I rate this set 5 stars.",5
"If you have a kid that loves legos, this is a cute and fun build. The 3 different varieties of animals is fun for mixing things up when you get bored of whichever you start with. My kids love these.",5
"I have only put the bunny together and it is on display. Very cute and awesome lego directions. I have been doing a lot of off brand kits and there is nothing like LEGOs. The bunny is pretty posable and the carrot and flower are cute.",5
"This would be a great gift for any animal lover. It is reasonably priced, but you get 3 cute animals for the price of one. I thought I would like the rabbit the best, but the cockatoo is currently hanging out by my plants. Its just adorable and gives you the fun of assembling lego as many times as you want.",5
"Was a gift. Kids had fun putting together, good instructions. Keep in mind majority of pieces are small.",5
"I love Legos, but the price point can be daunting. So the 3in1 sets are perfect! I feel like I always have something to do. And the creatures are adorable!",5
"My son bought these legos for his cousin for Christmas and they are so cute! She put it together right away and she loved it!!! She made the rabbit first and it was adorable!!",5
"This bunny lego set is a great deal for the money as it was much bigger than I expected and can be built as too different animals.",5
"My kid LOVES bunnies. I've had this in my cart for over a year & finally got it. My kid was busy & focused for hours, which is difficult for him. He loved this gift. Legos are the way to go for kids that have a rough time staying focused or interested.",5
"Granddaughter 8 loves everything Lego. Great product quality. Teaches both following directions and creativity.",5
"My granddaughter usually plays with these and can use them over and over for these this one, you can use it once and it’s soaking wet and it never dries. You pretty much buy it once for all this money and you have to throw it away don’t get it.",1
"So I received this book for a gift for Christmas and when the back of the page was fully glued down even tho it was clearly meant to come off.. it completely ruined the image underneath and the whole back of the book is torn off.. I’m very disappointed with this.",1
"The book I received had a bunch of hard glue stains on it. I’m not sure if this is the case for all orders but my experience was negative.",1
"Books arrived wet! Can’t be used anymore",1
"I recently bought this for a road trip for my toddler. It would of kept her busy if the water was easy to squeeze out of the pen, even I couldn’t do it. I was a little disappointed since I had to give her a cup of some water to keep dipping her pen into.",1
"It’s like trying to squeeze steel.",1
"This product is very disappointing. The pages are very flimsy. When my granddaughter paints, the pages get soaking wet and fold up. The paint with water by Melissa and Doug are much better. They have lasted through 3 grandchildren. I would not recommend this product.",1
"Ugh. Same thing happened to me as to a few other reviewers. The back of the notepad was GLUED to the packaging, making it impossible to remove the notepad without ripping off Bluey’s picture. Super weird. Not worth returning.",1
"The picture takes forever to appear, you have to draw for 20 seconds in the same spot to see the colors, even an adult doesn’t have that much patience to wait for it, compared to other brand this one is not good.",1
"Thought this would be fun for my 3 year old, but at her first use, the white part started coming off the day we received.",1
"The water instrument didn’t work. I had my child use a paint brush instead.",2
"My toddler son didn't seem to like this as much as I hoped. I think maybe because remains the same, in terms of the colours. I'm not sure but he didn't seem interested in it for very long. He's probably used it twice and hasn't asked about it since he first used it.",2
"I would suspect the item we received was directive, but the quality was poor and it seemed to be printed/assembled out of order.",2
"Pages were stuck together. Back page tore off package backing. Will present as horrible gift to my grandchild.",2
"Not the best one that we've ordered. The pen was useless after 1 use.",2
"The overall look of this is great and my kids LOVE it. I understand that it is a cheap source of entertainment but I have others of these for the same price that were better quality than this. The pages being cardboard are normal, but what I dislike is that the white over stuff, the stuff that makes this book what it is, balls up and scratches off way too easily. I’ve never had this issue before, even after months and months of use with the other water coloring books we have, and this is an issue I noticed first use with this product. You can see the scratches, which came from normal use, can be seen in all 3 of the pictures I’ve attached and the balling and sloughing off can be seen in the 3rd picture.",2
"If you are used to the Melissa and Doug water magic toys this is absolutely terrible. The pages are flaking off and I don't see it lasting longer than a few months. Do my kids still squabble over it because they love Bluey? Absolutely! So unfortunately not going to return, but hopefully Disney will get better materials for their merchandising because this is the third Bluely item we've bought now that does not work as it should. The water pen is cute so if you need a new one guess it might be worth it for some!",2
"I ordered this for my niece's birthday and it came bent up on the sides and dirty on the bottom corner. As this is a gift it's embarrassing giving someone something that is dirty and bent out of shape, so a word of caution to those buying as a present.",2
"It takes a lot to get the color to show up, which is very frustrating for toddlers who are used to the Melissa and Doug books (which show up with just one stroke). The pen also leaks more than other brands, so you actually have to empty it every time.",2
"Deteriorated quickly. My child enjoyed it but it didn’t last very long and started scratching off",2
"This water-activated drawing pad featuring Bluey characters is fun for kids, but the drawings fade quickly. It's enjoyable initially, but the lack of lasting color is disappointing. Good for price but quality is alright",3
"I have a few of the same brand without issues. For some reason, the pen leaks a lot. My kid still loves it!",3
"I was not aware that it is only 4 pages until it arrived (the display photo has that part covered up by the Bluey character). I think it is overpriced for only 4 pages. I'm not sure if they're reusable so maybe I'll update this review when I find out. *Update: they are reusable! Works great!",3
"We have bought a couple similar products by different brands and wanted this one since our daughter loves bluey. Essentially it's the same and our daughter doesn't notice the differences. Still colors with water, dries back white and has a few things to reveal. The brush seems to make a type of residue on the page that froths a bit, though it'll dry the same and hasn't felt sticky. There's not a lot to reveal, mostly just adds color. Pages are just basically glued to cardboard, and will warp if you get the edges wet. Has started to chip on the pages themselves, though I'm not sure if it's poor quality or toddler aggressiveness. Hasn't happened to the others we have, but can't say our kid might not be to blame.",3
"Bought this for a plane ride with my toddler. It's very cute and works well but only has 4 pages!!! For $6 that's a bit expensive.",3
"I was so excited to get this for my bluey obsessed little one, but I was a bit let down. There is a several second delay for the picture to show up, it takes a lot of water for it to show up, and there's a lot of dead space without hidden pictures or colors.",3
"We are a Bluey household (💙) & were excited to see a Bluey themed Aqua Art set. Unfortunately, this pales in comparison to M&D sets. The “paintbrush” tip fell out after 1 use. I “fixed” it, & it promptly fell out again. I will try to glue it in, if I can, if not, we’ll use one from another M&D book we have. They also have a huge missed opportunity to incorporate the “back” pages into fun games or seek & search options. There are literally 4 color pages, and some cute graphics on the back. We still love Bluey & will use this book (with another pen), I just wish it were more interactive (like other sets).",3
"My daughter loves the Melissa and Doug water art pads so we figured this would be a hit bc she also loves Bluey. Unfortunately the colors aren't as vibrant and the water takes a little longer to soak in and show the pictures so my daughter is constantly telling me it's ""not working"" 🙄",3
"If your kids anything like mine the bristles of a paintbrush will be stuck spread out weird from misuse. If you plan on getting this for a toddler, maybe get something else. It is mess free though!",3
"My girl really like it.. very cute! The only bad thing is that the pen is not squeezable- so it’s hard for a 3 years old how is not so patient 😂😂",3
"We purchased the book for my 19 month old who loves Bluey. Immediately after opening the box she was asking to play with it. We filled the paint brush with water and she knew exactly what to do. She was so excited to see her favorite characters appear in color and find the hidden animals throughout the page. It didn’t take long for the book to become one of her favorite toys.

We initially purchased the book for an upcoming trip because of the small size and easy cleanup. The only downside is that some of the colors start to bleed through overtime, so don’t expect it to last forever. Overall we are very happy with the purchase and will look to buy more of the aqua art books.",4
"A little water from the “brush” and the pictures reveal colors. When it dries colors disappear and you can redo. Only 4 pages of fun with this product. AND, this is a big one, two of the pages are exactly the same. Also, don’t press too hard or the pages scratch, as my 3 year old granddaughter did.",4
"The quality wasn’t what I expected upon opening. It is an Easter gift, so my kids haven’t used it yet.",4
"The only reason for giving this book a 4 star is the back page, the one used for hanging up in stores, was glued to the back page of the book and could not be taken off without ruining the back of the book. I cut away what I could, but they should not have done that. Other than that, the little ones love it and the moms do too, because it is mess free and can be used over and over again. Love Bluey!!!",4
"My daughter got this for Christmas. She loves it! The only down side is she puts a lot of pressure on the brush and then that's where it wears down the most. But all in all a good product for my kid.",4
"Play Video
These are cute and I have no doubt they will occupy our toddlers on our upcoming trip. I am a little disappointed however in the packaging. The way the packaging was glued to the product left some of the package on it as well as took some of the backing off one of the products. Pictures and video are posted. Now they look a little bad but still decent product.",4
"Compared to the other Melissa & Doug water art books I have, this one was a little lackluster. My toddler loves it but some of the overlay print didn’t match up and there was some pilling.",4
"Mess free way to color over and over again! Mine was a bit bent when it came in, so my recommendation for vendor is better packaging",4
"Several other types of these show the color quickly. My toddler got frustrated and stopped trying initially because it was taking time for the color to show up. If you don’t need one with Bluet I’d go with the Melissa and Doug brand.",4
"It’s cute but not super durable. Worth the price. We’ve used it over and over again.",4
"My 2-year-old loves Bluey, and loves her Water Wow books from Melissa & Doug. This was the perfect combo. It’s easy for her to paint, and once dry, she can paint again. These kinds of books are one of my favorite things to pack for travel and especially airplane rides. Mess-free, screen-free, inexpensive, reusable, and kids love them.",5
"This can distract kids for a long time. And it's reusable. Amazing",5
"""I'm painting! I'm painting!"" said our happy toddler as she worked the water brush gently over the blank Bluey art page. ""I'm painting!"" she exclaimed as her artwork became colorful. I really liked the art brush. You turn it to open. It separates into two pieces. Fill the bottom part with water, and then twist the top part back on it. I was impressed with how well it controlled the water flow onto the art page. Our toddler was very happy with this product and it was a lot of fun for her. Unlike crayons this water brush will not stain your walls, furniture, or vehicle. It is perfect for traveling in the car, playing outside, or inside. We highly recommend Bluey Aqua Art!!",5
"So easy for a toddler to use. Just good luck keeping the pen out of their mouth! The pictures and colors that appear are so amazing. I love the no mess design. Wish it had more than 4 pictures!",5
"Got this for my Bluey loving 2 yr old son. I Love its reusable and has thick pages. I think it'll last quite a while. I also love its just water that will color the pages, so no real mess and it preoccupies my boy for a good 30 minutes or more so mommy can get stuff done around the house. Definitely recommend!!!",5
"Super cute and fun for the car or plane!!",5
"These are so cool. Had my toddler engaged for a long time. The water brush is easy to use and doesn’t spill everywhere. And the best part is let it dry and use again and again",5
"I HAVE PURCHASED SO MANY OF THESE FOR MY GRANCHILDREN OVER THE YEARS! FROM TODDLER TO 8 YEARS OLD!! THEY LOVE TO WET THE PAPER & SEE THE SCENE COME TO LIFE.. GREAT INDOOR CRAFT FOR A RAINY DAY!",5
"This is a good gift for a 4 year old so they can not make a mess but still paint.",5
"This was purchased for a 3 and a 5 year old. They both enjoyed uncovering the pictures. It is easy them to use independently after the water pen is filled.",5
"To sum it all up in a short review, the blasters jams a lot and I mean a lot. It also tends to shoot out broken pieces of gel, mean while your finger gets tired from all the squeezing, not that easy to squeeze, starts to hurt after a bit, even with two fingers, wouldn’t recommend.",1
"I bought these not knowing what to expect. I hope yall dont make the same mistake. These guns barely shoot 3 feet. Not even enough force to make the bullets pop. Still if you wanna throw a solid gun at someone, this is the bs for you.",1
"Basically you paying for 2 junk safety glasses. the guns don't work even after following all the directions. The positive reviews most be written by the same group, pay attention. I knew it sounded too good to be true:",1
"Absolute piece of junk not electric it’s some trigger crap that doesn’t work and constantly jams complete crap this is why I never buy nerf because it’s just overpriced crap and pieces of plastic",1
"Got these all set up with my son and was really excited to use them, but they won’t even get a full bb out of the barrel before it explodes. Don’t waste your money or your time on these",1
"The beads shoot about 3 feet!! Completely JUNK!!!!!",1
"Item was missing eyewear, and the gel opened a d were placed within a ziploc bag.",1
"Just don’t. You’ve been warned.",1
"The gun doesnt shoot the orbie bullets out like it should nd jams up easly nd someshots seem to break the orbies",1
"Doesn't shoot. The amo breaks when u try.",1
"I bought this as a Christmas present for my 11 year old. He says it is difficult to pull the trigger. I bought the 2 pack so his friend could play with him and he's 12 and says the same thing. I tried it out and it is very still and does not have any power as we tried shooting a empty coke can and it didn't even knock it over. Very disappointed in this purchase.",2
"I got these from my son. They worked in the beginning but they don’t shoot very far and after about a month they stopped working.",2
"Shoots about 40% of the time. Almost worthless",2
"The price is excellent. The problem is it takes four hours to get the gel babies ready for the gun by that time you want to do something else.",2
"These guns barely work and when they do they crush the orbee. Would return if I could.",2
"It doesn't shoot far enough",2
"These blasters are ok. The problem is the trigger pull. Shooting it a few times isn't a big deal, but after going through hundreds of rounds, your fingers will be strained.",3
"There’s no prime - pulling the trigger fires the shot. Because it takes some strength to do this, the blaster moves when firing, leading to inaccurate shots. You won’t be winning any blaster wars with these.
They do look nice though and are fun to dual wield and play around with, bit not good for competitive play. A good buy when on sale.",3
"It's a fun toy, but even for me its difficult to pull the trigger. It's pretty stiff.",3
"It randomly fires multiples at a time, gets clogged a lot and about half of the gel darts explode when fired so the pieces just fall straight to the ground. We tried soaking at 3 and 4 hours. It's very small chamber so you spend a lot of time refilling and unclogging. Very hard to pull the trigger.",3
"I bought this as a family household gift for Christmas. One package is missing the important eye goggle protection. package says do not use without them....",3
"Does shoot but definitely not how advertised don’t know if these were broken but they shoot pike 2 or 3 balls at a time and barley shoot out. Never shoots out strong enough to pop",3
"The kids loved them but broke after one use",3
"They were really hard to use",3
"The trigger is relly hard to pull",3
"They work but hurt like hell.",3
"There's not really a lot to talk about here, this is really really simple. It's not bad though, it's definitely good and fun.

Good stuff:

The simplest and most straightforward Nerf Gelfire product out there. Reading the instructions will take you less than a minute

High firerate

It's quite accurate, perhaps even more accurate than the Ghost.

Bad stuff:

The top of the grip is quite cumbersome, after using it for a while, my thumb hurts a little.

Unlike the Ghost, this blaster is quite dodgy, if you pour too much water in the hopper. It might get stuck UNDER THE HOPPER, somehow.

Miscellaneous:

The trigger pull is quite heavy. Not really a bad thing, since, if you're looking for a double action blaster, you're pretty much asking for it. (The tip of my fingers feel quite sore after using it, but it's fine.)

PD: Thank you for lowering down the price after I buy it, Hasbro. Even better, now the ghost gets five bucks more. I hate this.",4
"I'm quite impressed with these little gel pistols. They boast impressive fps, leaving a welt and mild bruise for about a day at point blank range. For battling, these would be a blast for teens and adults. I think they're too much for kids fights. That said, a Pre-K child can shoot these two-handed (with some aiming assistance) and a 1st grader can operate them fine with a single hand. Kids love shooting down stacks of empty cans, or trying to shoot leaves in the trees.

One downside to these is that they jam about every 10-15 shots. It seems a combination of the gel bb breaking as it enters the chamber, a second bb getting smashed a bit as the first is chambered, and possibly slight variations of bb size.

Another, smaller, downside is that once the hopper is low, you can't really just keep shooting quickly; you must be sure there are enough BBs toward the front end of the hopper so they can feed properly. When you're really low on BBs, you have to jostle the pistol to get each BB in the chamber.",4
"These are interesting guns in that there is no cocking mechanism in the traditional sense. Instead, pulling the trigger is what performs this action. This means one handed operation for repeated shots.

The downside is that the trigger is hard to pull and the gun isnt as powerful as kids have to be able to use one finger to cock and shoot in 1 motion. But, if you want to go 2 pistol style, this is the way to do it.

They are nicely made and have held up well so far.",4
"Got these on sale so well worth the price. I was surprised that they are as accurate as they are and the FPS is pretty good too. Will buy another set if they go on sale again.",4
"I like that its easy to use, just point and pull the trigger. Cons are that sometimes it only shoots water specks or ""dry fires"" but if you if point it down for a sec it will fill the chamber.",4
"Each year we buy my son a perfect gun to play with. He loves the choice this year.",4
"If you wan't something for younger kids, this is a great option but it's not good for older kids.",4
"Fun little thing to have Kids like it. I would buy an automatic next time. If anyone has a automatic this thing doesnt seem that fun. You cant shoot as fast.",4
"Does not fire with power ever shot",4
"The guns were a lot bigger than I thought they would be. It was slightly difficult to load it but once it was loaded they were a lot of fun! I think for the amount that they are they were worth the price.",4
"I ordered a second set because it was a lot more fun than I thought. Its all mechanical and every shot has a sting. Compared to my Gelbees that shoot auto, these single shot pistols shoot a bit further with power. They look cool too.",5
"We are a nerf family! We all enjoy playing! These are so much fun! Great for shooting targets. I would say (as the mom) not so great for shooting at each other. They’re a little more painful. Love that they come with goggles/safety glasses because it’s needed. The gel blasters are similar to orbies, so does require a little bit of time to allow them to soak up some water. Other than that easy to use!",5
"These are less expensive and effective gun. We use these shoot roaches and the gun really kills. Now roachs are scared heard the trigger sound.",5
"These are very cool! Fun outdoor option with no darts to pick up",5
"I was surprised the amazing feet per second firing rate of these small gel pistols. Gel guns are not that accurate but Good fun. Great value for the price.",5
"My kids and I have wars all the time and love these",5
"I surprised my Boo with a Nerf gun fight. Best time ever! These didn't hurt but felt like little pings of styrofoam/ gel. BUY IT!",5
"grandson loves this!",5
"I bought these for a decent price ($20 for the pair) and I'll say this; these are my absolute favorite gel blasters in my entire collection. They're accurate, powerful, have very impressive range for such short barrels, hold plenty of ammo for their size, and make for an awesome sidearm or even a compact primary. My only grioe is that they sometimes have feeding issues if they get overfilled (gravity fed), but a quick shake and it's always back up and running. Recommend 100%, 10/10",5
"Everything as described. Good product.",5
"I bought the small pack for my child's easter egg hunt at preschool, but these arrived with all the hinges broken except for about three. The hinges are unnecessary so I wouldn't care if they're just weren't there, but because they're broken they have left behind little pieces of hard jagged plastic that can scratch you. I can't see giving these to a bunch of 3 and 4 year olds and potentially scratching or cutting them, so won't be using them.",1
"These are TINY and I mean TIIINY. The pictures they use to advertise are in no way reflective of what you get. You can’t even fit a fun size KitKat in these lil’ things. Maybe a Hershey kiss or two.",1
"I licked nothing about these plastic eggs. They are to small, they have holes in them so no candy can be put in them for egg hunts, the plastic is thin and flimsy. over all I would call them junk. Do not wast your time and money. I sent mine back.",1
"They didn’t all fit together and there were more bottoms than tops.",1
"I need to Easter eggs for my youth church Easter baskets and ordered this brand. You do get the volume for your money but the material very thin. The eggs were continuously popping back open and not staying shut. The size was too small to where you couldn't put a lot of candy in the eggs.",1
"Didn't work. Some were broken, and others just didn't stay together. Threw them out. Big waste of money.",1
"good for a day",1
"I bought these for an Easter egg hunt at my house. The eggs were hidden for maybe two hours. When the kids pick them up, they were full of ants. There are holes on one end of the egg that let the ants in. Do not buy these.",1
"So cheap would not even stay t back upog",1
"Over half the eggs will not close and shatter in 5-6 pieces when trying to close them. This is the worst product from Amazon I have ever received.",1
"The size of the eggs are as expected . Although it’s a puzzle making sure the tops & bottoms fit each other. The eggs are rather flimsy too.",2
"A lot of these wouldn't close, a few came broken, all very easily broke. We're looking again this year and won't purchase these.",2
"Two of the eggs arrived broken.",2
"These are pretty small. I bought the 150 pack for a church Easter egg hunt, but now I realize they were not a great deal. It would have been much more economical to buy 11 packs of larger eggs at Dollar Tree. Had I done that, I could have gotten much cuter ons as well (ie decorated plastic eggs or ones shaped as animals or dinosaur eggs). But I didn’t think it through very well beforehand. I opted for convenience and this purchase was definitely that, the two halves of these eggs are molded together which I was looking for. When you are filling thousand of eggs with candy, it’s helpful not to also have to search for two halves of the eggs to match up in the process.",2
"The eggs are sturdy and easy to fill. The fact that they are hinged means they are easy to snap together. I ordered the 100 pack and only received 96. May not seem like a big deal but I would like to receive what I paid for.",2
"Pros:
> Package came pretty fast
> Quality seems to be good and eggs are sturdy

Cons
> Upon unpacking I discovered that there were not 100 eggs in the bag. Missing over half of the eggs
> Eggs are pretty small",2
"I got my order the day of Easter, which was too late. I needed them prior to the actual holiday. I was surprised how small they actually are. I would not order them again.",2
"The colors are vibrant, and it's a lot of (little) eggs for the money. However, only about half of them were actually hinged. Several I had to pitch because they wouldn't snap closed, and the children haven't even touched them yet.",2
"It breaks easily",2
"Missing one whole sleeve about 50 short. It came in double pack only got 3 packs. I recounted 3 times. Short 50.",2
"Some of the eggs did not stay closed, pretty useless.",3
"I carefully read the description, examined the reviews and looked at all of the photos before I purchased these eggs for a community egg hunt. The item title (as of purchase, and as of writing this), description and photos all noted that these are *hinged* Easter eggs. The 2000-pack I ordered did not come with hinges. The egg bottoms came bagged up by color, while the egg tops came stacked separately within the same shipment (see photo). This meant that when volunteers arrived to help me stuff 2000 Easter eggs, I could not just give them a bunch of eggs, trusting that the tops and bottoms were hinged together. Instead, I had to specially count out matching tops and matching bottoms to make sure that everyone got items that fit together and had the right number of pieces. It was an unexpected hassle!

The three things I was looking for in the eggs were that they were longer than 2”, that they snapped together securely without popping back open, and that they were hinged. I will say that the size is as described, and they do seem to close securely. I am particularly thankful for that since if they were to pop open, without a hinge holding the halves together, parts could easily get lost in the grass.

I do not believe I received the advertised Dreidel Co. Eggs. At least there is no paperwork or packaging designating them as such. Instead the box says “Rhode Island Novelty” (see picture).

So, if you want solid eggs and it doesn’t matter to you whether or not they are hinged, I’d say go ahead and purchase these. If you definitely do or definitely don’t want hinges, I wouldn’t chance it, because sometimes these seem to come as described, and sometimes they do not.

3 stars for usable eggs, longer than 2”, that latch securely. I’m withholding 2 stars for misrepresenting the brand and for the products not being hinged as described.",3
"A couple of the eggs came broken and unusable.",3
"Cheap plastic, but you get what you pay for.",3
"Think plastic",3
"I bought them hinged for a reason. These in the photo were all broken and although they still could snap together, the broken hinge was a sharp piece that was not going to work for the tiny hands. In order to get my money back I have to take time out from MY schedule to schlepp to UPS! Never again!",3
"Yes these are plastic eggs, just stacked for the selling picture which make them look like a fun and festive array of adult “things”. They are ok, hard to snap together, but good for one time use!",3
"The hinges only last long enough for one kid to open it. Some close too tight but most barely close so you can’t put much of anything in it. Does the job I suppose but who wants to put tape on them to keep them closed?",3

"The product was exactly as described the price was wonderful and the delivery was Timely",4

"I purchased eggs to use as a attractant to Bee's for my garden. I placed a skew stick into egg and glued. placed all 50 eggs into garden ( for pollination ) and it worked like a dream, Noticed it has helped to bring in the Bee's to pollinate my garden plants and I'm having a good harvest. So there are more applications to these colorful eggs than just putting candy in them for the kiddo's . Not to mention it also makes your garden look good.",4
"Worked well for a work Easter Egg hunt. Some of them were broken but still fit together well. Had no issues with getting them closed. I could fit a fun size Skittles in them which was nice. Only downside that kept it from 5 stars was that I was missing 10 eggs which messed up my count. Would have been nice to have all 300 I ordered.",4
"Somewhat disappointed in thiness of shell and some hinges were broke. But I give it a ""10"" for interest to have a small toy in an egg and a unique jelly-like toy inside. My grand daughter has hours of fun playing with them! I definitely recommend this and hope they are available next year!",4

"Great eggs for decorating! I needed so many so I could show others how to découpage them and they were perfect. They held together well and were a perfect size. You could not put much in them if you wanted them to hold candy, maybe a few jelly beans!",5

"Expected the diaper to be bigger than size 7 but compared it to a size 6 & 7 pamper and it’s the same size as 7 , just a tad bigger than 6. Then compared it to a Huggies size 7 and the back part is just a tad bigger. One strap broke when I put on my baby , also it only strapped on the very end. So it’s basically holding on . My baby is big for his age and weighs 45 pounds. Very disappointed, had high hopes that size 8 was gonna do the job.",1
"So I have been purchasing all of my Pampers diapers on here for over a year now. I should have known on my last purchase when they looked different something was a-miss. The last order did not have the Sesame Street characters but instead little kitties, I thought no big deal, new marketing tactic? Then I started to really notice the difference....First off, they were visibly different in the overall size and thickness. They appeared to be much thinner and flimsy. The tabs ripped off several times. Many of the diapers had dark brownish spots under the material as if their was too much chemical or went something in production (I was too afraid to put the mystery spotty diapers on my son so I ended up throwing probably at least 8 away). They left little white pieces of material all over my sons bottom and WORST of all they gave him terrible diaper rash :(- which NEVER happens!!. After that I threw them out and ran to my local Target to get a new box of QUALITY pampers. Fast Forward to last week>>> I decided to go on amazon to check the reviews and many parents shared my same concern. I noticed when I went to place an order that their we very distinct NEW and OLD over each box, thinking they fixed the problem I was sure to order a NEW box of pampers hoping to get the standard Sesame characters I was used to but much to my disappointment (and $54 later) when the box arrived it was the same low grade diapers I had just thrown away.",1
"YOU RUINED PAMPERS SWADDLERS! WHY WOULD YOU EVER TAKE THE BEST DIAPER FROM #1 TO THE WORST DIAPER EVER MADE! I could tell from the second I opened the box and grabbed the first diaper! I am so MAD! I WASTED $50 ON A BOX OF DIAPERS THATS UNUSABLE!

All 4 of my kids wore Swaddlers and I happily paid for the last 10 or more years because I never once had to worry about diaper rash. I bought them to cure diaper rash! Well guess what?! WITHIN 45 MINS OF HAVING ON THESE ""NEW"" PAMPERS, MY SON HAD THE WORST DIAPER RASH I HAVE EVER SEEN! I HAVE BEEN PUTTING CREAM ON HIM FOR 4 DAYS AND IT ONLY GOT WORSE WITH THE DIAPERS! I'm sorry but $50 is a heck of a lot of money and all I had for diapers this month. No problem right? WRONG! I'm now trying to get my mom to go buy other diapers until payday because I feel terrible leaving him to wear these.

GUESS WHAT? I found a BABY DRY old diaper here (and I don't like baby dry much because they are too thin and leak sometimes) and but it on my baby in the mean time to give him a break from the new garbage diapers and his rash has all but DISAPPEARED in the four hours he had a break from those diapers! Put them back on...it is back. Needless to say, the new swaddlers really made me lose all respect for Pampers.... As much as we pay to put our babies in gold Diapers, they shouldn't be the ultimate junk overnight.

I never thought I would say this, but I won't be buying Pampers anymore. Honestly, I don't know what to buy now. That's all I ever knew. Swaddlers....the best, rash free, leak proof, overnight, plushest, softest, happy baby diaper ever made. Nothing even compared. Now, the most comparable thing would be a newspaper...thin, crunchy,.far from soft, leaks like a boss, burns your baby's bottom, and makes your baby very ANGRY.

Sad PAMPERS, SO DISAPPOINTED. Five stars for subtleties though (haha...the difference is astounding)....who do I call for my money back?",1
"Please do not buy this diaper especially from Amazon. Newborn babies are not comfortable with these diapers. They gave my newborn a rash and I also order Huggies from Amazon, they are more comfortable and soft. After that I decide to return the Pamper diapers, I contact customer service, they told me they don't return these items. I order two boxes for about $79.98. They told me you contact the seller and I contact the seller and then they told me they only exchange items but do not refund. They don't care about people's money. I shop a lot from Amazon to save time but now I'm really disappointed. And this is also my first and last review on Amazon thank you. I have decided to stop shopping on Amazon. Please everyone be careful with these diapers your newborn baby's skin is very delicate. I have all kinds of screenshot as a proof",1
"I usually don’t give bad reviews I am ordering diapers for my three months old and first time I ignored when I didn’t receive blowout diapers even it was real a hassle when my baby pooping every time it was leaking because no blowout protection but I am writing this review because it’s a second time I didn’t receive blowout diaper it’s showing on the box and even when I bought it was showing these are blowout protection diapers but when I opened the box it is the plain diaper I can’t believe I am paying for something and I am not what I am paying for😒😒",1
"We have been using Pampers Swaddlers since my 3 month old son was born, and we've found them to be the best especially with leaks and absorbency. We did not feel the same about other brands like Huggies. I just ordered my first box of Pampers Swaddlers this month since we had received a lot of diapers as gifts up until now so didn't need to purchase ourselves. I was excited to sign up for subscribe and save through Amazon. However these diapers are definitely NOT the same as the ones found in the store. They have been leaking for almost every poop diaper. At first I thought it was us not putting the diaper on correctly. But after almost a week of using these diapers and constantly having to clean up leaks, it is definitely the diapers. It leaks from the same spot every time. They also look different from the ones we had been using. I am not one to write bad reviews and perhaps we just got a random bad batch. But as every parent knows, it's tough enough caring for an infant. Now we wasted money on a box of diapers we don't want to use and need to run to the store to spend more money on a new box.",1
"Extremely bad fit for my 1 month old newborn. The back part is causing big problem. His Pee and poop would slip out from the back even if we have closed the diaper tight. Due to tight closing, baby has marks of diaper. We are folding the back and trying to use this pack. We certainly won’t be ordering next. Even the Velcro of diaper in front is loose/does not have the strength to stick. It is not sticky so opens easily. It gets stuck with our clothes when we’re holding baby and comes out.",1
"My grandson has worn pampers since birth. I just ordered a box of size 3’s as he’s growing out of 2’s. I’m very annoyed! The diapers arrived and they have a strong powdery scent as soon as I opened the box. My grandson has very sensitive skin and we purchase products with that in mind. When ordering these, there was NOTHING in the description that said these diapers were scented. If there had been, I wouldn’t have purchased them. There is also nothing on the outside of the box saying these are scented. Now I have a box of diapers that can’t be used. I’m extremely disappointed in Pampers as a brand now. They are in the baby business and should be aware of babies with skin issues and allergies. They should know better than to leave out this kind of info in their product description and on the box!",1
"PSA,

This brand is the worst brand I have ever used for certain reasons.

1. It’s way expensive compare to the other brands.
2. It’s way inconvenient for the child.
3. The size 8= size 7 of the other brand p****** c….
4. Your child’s skin is at 100 risk.

Since I switch to pampers, my child’s bottom is turning red and pealing his skin. We have been using other preventative treatments, but still very disappointing.

I stopped purchasing this and switched back to the first option.",1
"DO NOT BUY!!!!! The good reviews are probably from people with baby who need ever move! These diapers leak! All of them; no exception (all of the styles they sell) !!! I didn't know better as a new mom until I switched to another brand( I won't mention the brand cuz i'm not here trying to sell that one) !! My baby always woke up drenched with pampers! I always blamed myself for not putting the diaper correctly or maybe the diaper was full, maybe it was the style, etc.... 99% of the time the diaper was dry, and all the pee was out on my LO's clothes. UGHHHH the amount of laundry that I did due to this brand. It should be illegal that they sell diapers. I used this brand for 6 months I'm so so so upset!!! I switched to another brand and all is perfect 0 leaks... This is so upsetting. Not even the money, but just the fact my baby had to go through that due to bad brands and my lack of knowledge of which brands are good...",1
"Pampers swaddlers is our #1 favorite diaper. When we first started ordering for our 2nd baby, we were ecstatic about the new ""blowout protection"" that they did not have when we had our first child 4 years ago. It works great (usually), and I would swear up and down on them.

HOWEVER.

This gets a 2 star review because what is shipped is NOT what is in the picture, although it IS Pampers Swaddlers. Sometimes you receive the new ones with blowout protection (the ones advertised and in my picture on the right). Sometimes you get the old ones (in my picture on the left) and lose a onsie or several to level 6 poopie disasters. And seeing as we already need diapers from the new box before we realize they are the wrong swaddlers (why in the world are they branded the same style/name when they have radically different characteristics and performance?!), we can't really return/replace them.",2
"I know for fact Pampers changed their production on this collection of diapers. These used to be great however that is no longer the case. I have used these on and off between my previous three kids. Now my youngest, now one, did use these as a newborn which was under the older diaper produced. This new box is rank. I don't like it one bit. The diaper for one has a fragrance on it. I don't remember the older diapers having one. These are also a bit bulkier than I remember. Lastly the crystals used to absorb don't do their job properly. Once fully wet, they don't hold as much as they used to and they don't stay put. I'm constantly looking at the crystals in the diaper on my child as if she's urinated in it two or more times. This is absurd. The diaper isn't sufficiently used to have the crystals inside everywhere on my child.

I bought the box because I needed today not next week. I'm extremely disappointed in the change Pampers made to this diaper collection. What's worst is the fact they still has contracts with various hospitals with this updated, poorly made diaper. I'm not returning to Pamper's brand nor am I recommending it.

If you can swing the funds, get a bamboo based diaper or try Target's exclusive Millie Moon. They are so much better for your baby's bottom and they hold up well. They are also a lot softer than anything Pampers' puts out.

Update August 31st, 2023

I ended up using most of these diapers given that I didn't have the funds to immediately replace. My daughter ened up getting a nasty diaper rash from the diaper, right up to the leg opening. Now she's had one previously but not to this extent. Rash was all over and taking eons to heal.

Pampers claims that their diapers don't cause diaper rash or chemical burns but this is ridiculous. I'm not the first parent to say Pampers caused a nasty rash on their baby.

I have sense gone back to my other diaper brands of BabyCozy/MomCozy and Target exclusive Millie Moon. These two brands coupled with Destin / Burts Bees branda of diaper rash ointment got her rash under control in 48hr. Both brands of diaper rash ointment has 14 percent or higher of zinc oxide which definitely aides is clearong redness and lumps quicks which protecting the sensitive skin from moisture.

Overall, Pampers brand of diaper is a nightmare. I knew they were rank given personal testimony from a good friend now it's even more apparent with my own experience. Pampers really needs to reformulate their diapers as parents shouldn't be experiencing this level of diaper rash with use of their product. I am not returning nor would I recommended them to the next family.",2
"Be aware! Expecting a newborn means sleepless nights and tired minds. We received our diapers and worked well until baby started to cluster feed- it was blowout city! We found out the hard way that we received diapers without the barrier in the back. Make sure you pull one out and check before you use up the entire box, cause let me tell yah. . . they start pooping fast and furious. Other than that, the diaper is soft and absorbent. All in all good quality, so we are a bit confused as to why they were marketed with the barrier.",2
"I bought Pampers for the first time, previously only used Huggies. The quality, feel, softness, thickness, seems superior to that of Huggies, but the scent is unacceptably strong. Huggies have no scent at all and feel much cleaner, these Pampers diapers smell too chemical. I opened the box already and will use what I have but will never purchase again. I had no idea diapers can have a scent, nor I think they should - it can’t be healthy when it sits so close to the baby’s skin all day.",2
"Huggies never leaked on my baby while pumper do leak very often, it dud 2x same day at regular home routine

Baby is on mid journey of size 2, so it is not the babys size the issue, specially that other brands do not leak",2
"Newborn size. We'd actually used this brand in the hospital so ordered some for home but have been disappointed-had several tabs pop open leading to poop smears, and they just don't fit as well as the huggies brand we also tried.",2
"I was very hopeful, not gonna lie. My 8 year old daughter is disabled and sizing out of size 7 soon. I didn’t know there was a size 8. I was excited when I found out.
Just received them and they are actually smaller than Cuties size 7 and the tabs aren’t as stretchy so they dig into her hips MORE than one size down. Very disappointed. I would really like to see bigger sizes for disabled people to cover the gap between size 7 and junior sizes of other incontinence suppliers. And as usual these come with the downside of a very strong Pampers odor. Gross. Giving two stars because I haven’t seen the absorption yet and it’s probably fine. Size is the issue, not quality .",2
"We’re always using pampers swaddlers for almost four years now. But this is the first time we encountered this. I just switched from number 3 to #4 and My baby is having a rashes. Now I have no idea if they will reimburse you for this. It’s not cool 🥺 can’t use this.",2
"I have exclusively used these diapers from Amazon for my 3 month old daughter and this is my 3rd shipment. I am confused and disappointed that this 3rd shipment contains diapers of lower quality. The material is thinner and does not cling around the baby's leg as well. The description of this product does not match the diapers I have just received. Why the change and how do we avoid this in the future?",2
"I have used Pampers for my son since he was born, but now that he is a toddler and moves around so much, the fluff and absorbency part of the diaper always comes out and sticks all over ever crevice of his bottom, even with regular diaper changes every 3hrs. I finally hit my limit and decided to switch brands. I know the package says it comes off with a wipe but it never comes off easy and the amount of fluff and tiny pieces of absorbency has gotten ridiculous. Maybe I'll try them again for our 2nd one since I never had a problem with the newborn or smaller sizes.",2
"Bought these for my niece that just had a baby. How do people afford babies now? I remember buying a 100 diaper pack for $15 17 years ago.",3
"Pampers support has been super helpful. My only con is that, to me, it fit the same as a size 7 in parents choice brand.",3
"These are supposed to be among the best, but we have found cheaper diapers that have worked better. Bought to get an Amazon digital credit :)",3
"We wanted to love pampers and tried so hard to use up all of the ones we ordered but they cannot withstand poop lol. They are prone to blow outs! We switched to the Honest brand and we no longer have blow outs. Obviously use what is best for your kiddo, but for us these were not it.",3
"After trying out different brands (Huggies, Coterie, etc.) we settled on Pampers Swaddlers as our favorite for absorbency and overnights (this was between May 2022 - Jan 2023). Unfortunately, Pampers changed the diaper product earlier this year (but not the price, of course!). The updated Swaddlers are significantly thinner, and now we're back to dealing with overnight leaks. I used to recommend this product but now, I'd say keep shopping and price comparing. This product isn't any better than the rest.",3
"I didn't realize how important the extra elastic band around the waist was. My baby is breastfed with very runny poo that always ends up going up her back and right out of the diaper. This doesn't happen with walmart brant (parent's choice) since it has the elastic band on the back. She's had major poops that were backed up for days that stayed put in those diapers. It was like a little bowl of thick soup in there when I opened up the diaper. She will go a fourth the amount in these pampers and it goes right out the back, staining onsie after onsie. I'll finish this box, but I don't plan on purchasing more pampers for my little one.",3
"i use pampers with all my children due to allergies to other brands but this is a first! i found some diapers that didn’t have the sticky part on one side of the pamper. It’s useless and waste of money considering how many diapers i buy for my newborn! i tried to reach out to get a refund or another box but no luck yet",3
"I very rarely can access a large box of swaddlers and it’s the only diaper that fits my daughter well. So grateful for this amount.",3
"For a few dollars more you can get different brand and not have blow outs up the back",3
"The new version of the diaper with the blowout barrier is great. We received the old version without it and have had leaks even with just pee. Beware when you order you may be getting old inventory.",3
"I tried many diapers for my little one but these stuck. I do have to be honest and say they are fragranced diapers which I'm not a fan of but they have not caused a reaction on my babies skin. I'd recommend for everyone to at least try these out even though they are scented. I wish they would have unscented options for those who are scared of skin reactions but that's just my opinion.",4
"I've been using these diapers for 4 years and 3 kids. They work well. Unfortunately, they've added patterns and designs. I originally chose these diapers largely because they were plain white. Over the years they've gradually added more and more patterns and pictures. It's annoying but the diapers still work so I guess we're stuck.",4
"They get expensive though",4
"Me gusta mucho esta marca de pañales. He estado usándolos desde q nació mi bebé y la calidad es buena. Use además unos de otra marca y no me dio resultado pues le provocó rash en la piel a mi bebé así q volví a estos y honestamente los recomiendo al 100.",4
"Have used pampers on me, my child now my grandchild. But they don't make them like they used to. I'm telling you we have tried EVERY brand out there and no matter what at night she leaks through them and that even with me changing her while she sleeps to try to prevent leaks.",4
"Will buy again but my baby growing fast so maybe another size runs perfect to size maybe should run a little bigger but i guess I’ll just order bigger size other than that these diapers are pretty good",4
"Not good when it’s a gift.",4
"This product is generally good for me. But when I felt size #2 is getting smaller, bought #3. But when using #3, it's a little extra big and leaking.",4
"I have 3 little ones and this has been my go to for all 3. I've tried numerous diapers and have yet to find a diaper that works for my children's sensitive skin AND holds up to the leaks. The only time I ever struggled with leak protection is when I had to size up. Is there something more expensive that holds up better? Maybe. But for me between the price and quality, it's a buy.",4
"My baby always use pampers, not leak out.",4
"As a parent, I know how important it is to find the perfect diaper that not only keeps your baby dry but also aids their comfort. Pampers Diapers have been a game-changer for my little one, and here's why I can't recommend them enough.
Absorbency: Pampers Diapers is by far the best choice for keeping my baby dry for an extended period. The advanced technology used in these diapers ensures rapid absorption, preventing leaks even during those extra-long naps and or throughout the night.
Comfort: The softness of Pampers diapers is unmatched. The gentle material they are composed of feel like a cozy hug against the baby's bottom, which avoids irritation and discomfort. The flexible design also allows for easy movement, ensuring that my little one can explore comfortably.
The Fit: Pampers offers a wide range of sizes to cater to different baby shapes and sizes. The secure and snug fit around the waist and legs provides extra protection against leaks, allowing your baby to move freely without any obstacles.
Wetness Indicator: One of my favorite features is the wetness indicator. It takes the guesswork out of diaper changes by visibly showing when it's time for a fresh one. This handy feature has saved me from unnecessary diaper checks and has proven to be a real time-saver.
All in all, Pampers Diapers has become a staple in our household. They are our go to for our baby. No other diaper compares. Pampers truly delivers on its promise of keeping both babies and parents happy!
100% recommend this diaper.",5

With a one-month supply included in this pack, you can have peace of mind knowing that you'll have an ample supply of diapers on hand to keep your little one clean, dry, and happy.",5
"First off, let's talk about the fit. Pampers diapers are like the fairy godmothers of the baby world, magically molding to your little one's bottom with a snugness that rivals Cinderella's glass slipper. No saggy business here – these diapers cling to your baby's bum like they're auditioning for a superhero sidekick role.

Now, the absorbency. I'm convinced Pampers diapers are made with the same material as astronaut suits because they can handle any liquid mission. Whether it's a surprise midnight fountain or a casual afternoon drizzle, Pampers has got it covered – literally. It's like a protective force field against leaks, and I can almost hear the diaper whispering, ""You shall not pass!"" to any potential puddles.

Let's talk design. Pampers knows that style matters, even in the world of diapers. The adorable prints on these bad boys turn your baby's tush into a canvas of cuteness. It's like having a miniature art exhibit in your living room, and the best part is, you're the curator.

And can we talk about the easy-breezy tape situation? Pampers has mastered the art of tape application. It's like they've hired tiny ninjas to ensure a swift and stealthy closure. No fumbling around in the dark with these diapers – it's a one-and-done, tape-and-zoom situation.

In conclusion, Pampers diapers are not just diapers; they're the unsung heroes of parenthood. They make you laugh in the face of diaper disasters, and with their magical fit, absorbency prowess, and stylish designs, changing diapers becomes a whimsical adventure. So, here's to Pampers – the diapering MVPs that turn every mess into a masterpiece!",5
"We normally use Huggies Little Movers with our 3.5 year old (nothing against them, they're also great diapers) but recently decided to give Swaddlers a try, and will not be going back. This is a top-of-the-line diaper and excels in all ways.

We use a size 7 though could *probably* get away with a size 6, and use about 4-5 diapers a day on average (not including his overnight diaper) depending on how much he's had to drink and how often he poops -usually once a day, but could be as many as 3 times, especially if he doesn't go one day.

The first thing you notice about these diapers is how soft they are. I mean, they just feel like they would be comfortable on a child, and since they're in them practically 24/7, that's important. The diaper is mostly white, and the overall designs are more muted than a lot of other diapers, with ""Shilo and Friends"" -an elephant and duck - on the front and back. I personally wouldn't mind something bolder, I don't think my child cares or even notices. There is a wetness indicator that goes down the length of the diaper, front and back. Nice to have I suppose for a caregiver who maybe doesn't change a lot of diapers, but at this age and stage, it's easy to know and tell. Like all Pampers diapers, they are scented. I happen to love the gentle powder-like scent, but it's a turn-off to some who describe it as too strong, and of course, if your child is sensitive to that, you may want to avoid Pampers diapers.

Inside, the top sheet liner keeps his skin dry, even when he wets heavily -which is usually - and does a good job of keeping poop from sticking to his bottom. The ""blowout barrier"" in the back also helps contain any messes. In terms of absorbency, I'm pretty amazed at how much they can hold. Being a little older, he tends to stay drier for longer periods and then pee a larger amount at one time, but the diaper almost always holds it in, and leaks are rare.

The one thing I wish that Pampers did do was have wider tapes, like Huggies, at least on the larger sizes, where kids are more active. It hasn't been a problem, so I don't really have a reason for saying that, other than that it seems like it would help with fit, but it certainly won't keep me from buying or using them in the future.",5
"Pampers Swaddlers Diapers with the Blowout Barrier have become a staple in our home. The combination of no diaper rash, impressive absorbency, and the added blowout barrier make them a reliable choice for us and other parents looking for a high-quality diaper. While the price may be slightly higher than some alternatives, the peace of mind and overall performance justify the investment. I highly recommend these diapers to parents who prioritize their baby's comfort, skin health, and protection against leaks.",5
"It’s been over a decade since I helped raise a kid so I’m probably behind the times here but I’m just blown away by how absorbent these are. No leaks at all. Very awesome.",5
"We’ve tried all the different diaper brands and styles within those brands. We will always come back to these even though they are more expensive per diaper. My son’s skin doesn’t break out with these, they hold a lot without blowouts and they’re soft and comfortable. We recently tried the premium Hugg!es L!ttle Snuggl3rs and were so disappointed. The quilted bottoms in the Swaddlers is well worth the extra cost!",5
"I know not all babies are the same, however, both of my children do great with this brand. Some of the other pampers brands or other brands entirely didn't work as well. Others would either be too think and cause my little girl to have diaper rash, or they would leak constantly. I have random leaks, but only at night. I have learned if you put the diaper higher in the front at night (since they usually stop going #2 in the middle of the night after they get a little older) this keeps them from leaking (my babies rolled to their stomach). If they are back sleepers, better to have it raised slightly higher in the back.",5
"I had to move up to size 8 for my 2 (almost 3) year old niece that lives with me. She was previously using huggies because thats what I could find in stores near me. The swith to Pampers has been great! She feels alot better in the newer size. It is very difficult to find bigger sizes for younger kids who need them so glad that these are working out! Hopefully we will start making progress on the potty training but until then we will be using these!",5
"First l love the price!!! Fit my baby perfectly. Better then the one l bought in store. For the next year l will only get my diapers with this seller ( as long as the price doesn't get higher) thank you seller...If you read the description package will Very. I got extremely 186 diapers package good.",5
"I’ve been using Huggies natural care wipes and Huggies diapers since my son was born, he’s 6 months now. At first everything was great but around 2 months we noticed a diaper rash and were quick to try and remedy it. NOTHING work we tried creams and frequent and immediate diaper changes (literally as soon as he peed or pooped) Breastmilk strait from the source, and even changed diaper brand. Finally changed the wipes and it cleared up next day like it was never there! I don’t know why but glad we got it figured out",1
"I’ve used 3 different wipes since my daughter was born. She is 3 months now. I started off with this brand but I noticed my baby getting diaper rash. Switched to water wipes and that went away. now i use pampers aqua since they’re cheaper than the water wipes and have no diaper rash still. sensitive my butt",1
"I got the box with 12 packs, I opened box and divided for grandkids, some of the seems were split at bottom of package( which I can get past) but then my son sends a photo from one of the packs he opens for child, it looks like needle marks in package top with blood in the wipes., they are all garbage after that.",1
"I don't know where the problem lies, as I usually lovvveee Huggins wipes. They are usually so much better than pampers and are my go to. We were out of wipes and thought ordering off Amazon would be more convenient. Never again. These wipes while from the same brand and are the exact same as we get from the store feel completely different. These wipes are dry and feel very rough. On quite a few of them the end of the wipe you can even see it thinned out and a different texture. Overall not impressed and am sad as the wipes from the store are generally fine.",1
"When I received these wipes, they were opened and had loose dirty packages in a usps mailing box. Nothing from Huggies clearly. I have attempted multiple times to reach them. Finally was told to ship back for a refund. I’m not paying out of my pocket for the wipes to be returned. I asked for a return label and address to send. 9 days later… still no reply.",1
"I was thrilled to find a Black Fridays offer, diapers and wipes, lots of them for $53 but this wipes are hard to get out of the package so they often ripped, they are smaller than others, and not soft. Big disappointment, I’m definitely never get it Huggies wipes again",1
"I’ve never had a problem with this brand until now. I’m not sure why the wipes are falling apart/leaving residue on my baby’s bottom. It’s been a big inconvenience because as I try to clean they just make a bigger mess with little pieces of wipes. I’m not sure if this was an old batch of wipes or what happened.",1
"So overpriced and not worth it. The parent choice wipes from Walmart are better than these. You don't get enough for what you pay. I wouldn't recommend.",1
"I don't know if this is a fluke or not but these are not very moist. I use these to clean my skin during times water not available. I have bought Huggy wipes for years and never experienced this before so hoping it was just a bad batch. I have always kept these in my car so that I can clean my hands and sometimes my face before I get home. You have to use three or four of the wipes instead of 1 like I normally do. I will be switching to a different kind in the future.",1
"I’ve been ordering the Huggies wipes for a few months. It’s easy to tear but not bad quality for the price. However, I’ve received 11 packs per box twice already…… not sure why..",1
"First time mom here. I love Huggies diapers but I recommend Pampers Wipes.
These Huggies wipes are dry as soon as you take them out of the package and brittle. I have to use like 5 for a poopy, whereas pampers I only have to use 1-2 wipes.
BUY PAMPER WIPES INSTEAD; they stay wet, smell amazing, and they’re so soft on babies bum!",2
"Have been ordering these via Amazon forever, with great approval.
However, the last order surprised me considerably when noticing that the package was
nearly two full inches shorter than previously. Seriously??? Yes.
Do manufacturers really think we don't notice being shortchanged, I wonder??
Will be seeking another brand next time . . .",2
"I had a hard time cleaning my children with these wipes due to their dryness. As a result, you needed at least 4 wipes to thoroughly clean them.",2
"They are too dry",2
"I felt these were small, dry, and made my son breakout in a rash. Seventh generation wipes are the absolute best",2
"These are absolutely terrible. They are fragile and tear easily. They don;t clean well but seem to leave my baby's skin wet so I have to let her air dry longer than usual before putting a fresh diaper on her. And I think they are giving her a little bit of a rash, which has never happened with any other wipes I have tried. Unfortunately I bought a huge box of these because she has never had issues with any other wipe I have tried (pampers, honest, amazon essentials, CVS generic, etc.), so I assumed these would be fine but NOPE. Now I am stuck with them, I might give them away if the irritation continues.",2
"Not wet or smooth enough. I had to press a lot harder to clean which gave my baby a bad rash.",2
"Says for sensitive skin but it hurts more than other wipes I've tried and it is not soft in any way. Has caused bleeding. Don't recommend. Cute packaging though.",2
"I am very disappointed with these wipes. I had previously ordered Huggies #B073W263GV and they were superior to these, and that’s what I thought I was ordering this time, and it turned out not to be the case.

The disappointing features of these wipes are: They are not as moist as I would expect them to be—and they are THIN.

I will not be ordering these again, and instead will stay with the aforementioned product.",2
"Quality seems to have went way downhill from when I used to buy them. I never used to have a problem with huggies wipes, now they constantly tear apart easy, there's always pieces of the wipe being left behind on my child, and I seem to be having to use way more just to get them cleaned. I'm not sure if it's the actual huggies brand that's went down or if it's just the ones bought off Amazon.",2
"Thankful that package was delivered on time and placed exactly where you said it would be. Like the bundle, saves time and money, and I don't have to worry about how quickly it will run out. Saves my son from having to buy them for me and me forgetting to ask him when I get too low. Thank you.",3
"Iv never been a Huggies fan however these aren’t so bad. They aren’t to thin or to thick. My only problem with them is that they get dry when wiping. So I have to use more than I should",3
"We don't care for these wipes too much. They do the job enough and aren't the worst ones we've used. But, they stick together too much and aren't very soft. Won't buy them again.",3
"The product is much thinner and also not as soft compared to the last batch we purchased. Shrinkflation maybe.",3
"Not wowed by these. They are thin, rip easily, and stick together when pulling them out of the wrapper/container/thing.

Would recommend something other than these if you're not on a budget.",3
"They worked okay, they just weren’t very wet so we ended up using more to clean up the mess. I do like how they easily pull apart and I like the snap close lid.",3
"Open easily the lid",3
"I like the lack of irritants; however, the wipes aren't as wet as other Huggies wipes OR other wipes, so I have to use more of them for poopy diapers.",3
"I’ve tried several brands of wipes. I like to keep them in the car and in the bathroom for quick cleanup of hands these wipes tear apart quickly even the CVS store brand is better.",3
"I tried these because I like the diapers better than pampers. Unfortunately these wipes irritated my sons skin leaving red bumps like it almost scraped his poop off instead of soften and clean. I will not be re ordering these, sticking to pampers wipes!",3
"My first baby we used Water Wipes almost exclusively due to her having sensitive skin. When baby #2 rolled around, we experienced the same sensitive skin but were no longer able to afford the price tag. After a lot of trial and error, we came across these Huggies and have had zero complaints. They also have a hard plastic top which closes nicely unlike some others which close with a sticker. Been our go to for the past 2 years.",4
"They are fine wipes but sometimes they leave behind debris.",4
"I like these wipes but they do tear easy. They are gentle on bottoms and clean well.",4
"Good quality and good value",4
"Switched from pampers to huggies. It’s thicker than pampers but a bit less stronger when pulled apart. Still cleans very very well. And I like that it’s natural and no harsh things added",4
"I like these wipes but when I pull them out they stick together causing me to waste more than I’d like. But the formula is sent I’ve on my little one so still a great wipe",4
"My family has been a fan of Huggies wipes for years. My elderly mother really needed the wipes for her sensitive skin. The wipes are durable, yet soft enough to handle delicate areas. I’m glad I purchased these wipes for her.",4
"I love the Huggies Natural Care Sensitive Baby Wipes! They're unscented and hypoallergenic, perfect for my baby's delicate skin. The pack of 12 flip-top packs is convenient, and the wipes are thick and effective. The only issue is that they sometimes tear when pulling them out of the pack. Despite that, these wipes are gentle and reliable for my baby's needs, and I would recommend them to other parents.",4
"First, the product itself is great. It is a wonderful way to clean your hands when soap and water are not readily available (such as while outdoors or in the car). When our power was out due to a storm, we used them to bathe. We also use them to do a quick dust when needed or to wipe off surfaces. In a pinch, you can remove make-up with them---though I don't recommend using them regularly for that purpose. The only downside I see is that I'm not sure exactly how biodegradable they are. I mean, do they sit in the landfill for a hundred years like newspapers or diapers or do they break down quickly? I just don't know.

Now, for the negative bit. Whoever delivers these to our area is an inconsiderate idiot. On a rainy day recently, someone drove passed our house and threw the box out the window. Fortunately, it landed in the driveway rather than in the filled ditch next to it, and my husband just happened to be walking the dog when this occurred and was quickly able to get the box into the house. The funny thing is this delivery arrived on the correct day but is listed as ""delayed"" in my account information! Another time, we found the box in the middle of the front yard. Once, we got a message that the box had been delivered, but we never received it. (We did get a refund from Amazon.) I can only hope your delivery service is better than ours for this one product as we've never had any problems with any other items from Amazon.",4
"Excellent quality.",4
"I've used Huggies wipes for years. These are great dependable wipes. I'm always glad I have these with the toddlers truly need them. They're soft even on the tenderest of places, there's not much scent to these wipes at all. I like that. A toddler needs a clean experience not another smell. These do not tear easily either, even when a toddler accidentally helps themselves to one. These wipes have increased in price, but this is a good value overall. Especially compared to buying in smaller quantities. One thing babies go through is a lot of diapers and wipes so I appreciate these value sized wipes a lot. Huggies has always had a great reputation and this continued with that reputation. I have only good things to say about these wipes. I'd recommend them. Thank you.",5
"I have been using this brand and kind of wipes for at least 10 years. I like that they do not have a strong fragrance because two of my kids are very sensitive to smells. Yet there are strong and soft at the same time. You do not need many wipes to get the job done, so there is less wipe waste. The package is very convenient and allows one handed dispensing. It has the right amount of wipes to keep in your diaper bag or purse for every day errands or a quick trip somewhere without having to take a lot of containers of heavy wipes. They are not flushable but I use the diaper genie when it is necessary. I like everything about them and sometimes you will find them on sale too and that is when I buy two boxes at a time. I love this product and will recommended to everybody.",5
"I love these wipes I got the Huggies natural care with cucumber and green tea for my baby shower and they are soft and really good and decided to just get Huggies wipes but with these they have a sandy like texture good price and good quality but I just can’t get over how it feels like a sand paper/wipe mixture every time I buy these but like I said other then that I love these wipes!",5
"Huggies wipes have become an indispensable part of my parenting toolkit. Their gentle formula is a blessing for my baby's sensitive skin, providing a thorough yet soothing cleaning experience. The durability of the wipes is impressive – they effortlessly tackle messes without tearing. The resealable packaging ensures long-lasting freshness, making them convenient for use on the go. I appreciate the subtle fragrance that adds a pleasant touch without overwhelming. Huggies wipes consistently deliver on their promise of effectiveness and reliability, making diaper changes and cleanups a breeze. For parents seeking a gentle and dependable choice, Huggies wipes are a clear winner. Highly recommended for their quality and convenience!",5
"Trusted brand. Great smelling and very soft. Great for baby's sensitive skin. Good price. Would recommend.",5
"These wipes are easy to pull out of the bag and don’t stick to one another like pampers ones do. They are great for wiping anything!!! We used this brand to change my triplets diapers …. We must have gone though 500 packages for them. We loved this brand way more than others because of it pulls out of the package, the thickness, and the durability of each wipe.",5
"I like huggies wipe ,the wipes to exactly what I need it to do. They thick and do a clean up job with ease. I really like being able to purchase in quality as well. Would recommend to anyone.",5
"These are my favorite wipes and let me tell you why. They are not super soaking wet, they are not over or under scented, their perforated instead of all slapped together to where you only pull out one or two wipes as opposed to the whole bag at once like the other leading brands. My spouse has also voiced his love for these wipes for the same reason. The other brands are too soggy and to drippy when you pull them out and when you pull one you pull 100. I just love that somebody had the sense enough to perforate wipees. These are durable and my finger does not go through them like other brands. These are just an all-around crowd pleaser.",5
"I would love to use water wipes but honestly they're so expensive. These are great and seem to not irritate my LOs skin and so much better than the pampers ones I had. The pampers one were such a pain, every time I'd reach for a wipe, I'd get like three. Which with a newborn wasn't that bad but diaper changes are like wrestling a rolling gator now so that got old really fast.
My favorite part of these is that most of the time, I get one wipe at a time.",5
"Wipes aren't just for babies and these wipes are the thickest and softest around! They can't be flushed but that's what trash cans are for. Give them a try! You'll be hooked, too!",5
"The fact that this product has five stars is continued proof that the bad mother problem is ubiquitous. These are supposed to be scent free but they have a very strong nasty alcohol smell even though I’m aware they contain no alcohol. The second the reason I got these instead of the Huggies I usually get is because it said it has a single tissue grab system but that has not worked one time. I’ve wasted literally 5-8 extra sheets each time cuz I grab out ten when I only want 1. It’s true my l.o. has not had any reactions but that’s the same for the other same type of products and this one costs twice as much so really not sure why this has 5 stars.",1
"There is something inherently broken in the wipe dispensing function. The way these are made, you can’t just pull out one. I even shopped for dispensers and reading the comments, other users specified point out that the dispensers do not work with Pampers wipes. It’s literally just this brand that can’t seem to figure this out. I’d argue this is where you need the technology to work the most. This sucks. Do better Pampers.",1
"What you receive is only 8 POP TOP wipes with 4 of the refill type packs which are the ones where if you don't have the container made to hold refill packs you end up losing a lot of wipes because using the refill packs as is you will eventually rip a tear into the pack and your wipes end up drying out. I would NOT have purchased if I knew that there wasn't going to be 12 Pop tops and they conveniently have that fact listed wayyyy down on the page instead of showing the actual contents and telling you that further up where they list all of their other promotional jargon",1
"I dislike this product, because when I pulled up the tape to take out a wipe four or five came out at one time. When I tried to put them back in the paper on the package ripped wide open, I am sending these wipes back. I’m 70 years old with a bad knee and I have to carry this very heavy box to the UPS store. I don’t even know if I can.",1
"Some of the packages in the box did not come with a snap lid, just a sticker closure over the opening. The wipes stick together and it’s difficult to get out just one at a time. They seem thin and of a lower quality than I usually expect of Pampers.",1
"Pampers is our go to wipes. However when we ordered this we were shorted 2 packs in the box. We were in short supply and needed these desperately. The wipes themselves are very good.",1
"I specifically ordered this product because the picture shows pop top containers. Now I have a box full of the garbage plastic sticker tops on the wipes. They stop sticking really fast, so this wasn’t a helpful purchase for us.",1
"These do NOT have a plastic pop top as the pictures indicate. Instead, there is just tape that you unstick each time you open them. Would not have purchased if I knew.",1
"Contrary to the featured photos of this item, these do not come in a dispenser packages. They are only refills. Disappointed that they do not match any of the photos.",1
"I received this package today it look like it was open and resealed missing 2 packs of wipes this is the second time this has happen. My sister purchase to boxes of wipe for me and I was missing 3 in one box and 2 in another box. I didn’t think nothing of it because I didn’t know where it was purchased.",1
"The box was missing one of the flip top packages. I tried to report the issue was directed to call Pampers.
All Pampers did was send me a $5 coupon via mail 🙄. $5 won’t even cover the cost of one package of wipes. The coupon says it has to be used on a case of wipes. Pretty annoying honestly. I know it may seem silly to some but I paid for 12 packages not 11. Won’t be buying these from here again because of this issue.

Giving two stars because of the issues and how Pampers handled the situation. The wipes are great we have been a costumer for years.",2
"These wipes work perfectly fine - they are durable and pretty large. Unfortunately the packaging is absolutely awful.

Half of the wipes in the box did not have a easy seal plastic blue pop top - they were just the plastic packaging. If you're not careful you can rip more than the opening and then the wipes will start to lose moisture or the sticky part doesn't really last so you'll lose moisture even if you do properly pry it open.

What's the absolute worst is that you need TWO hands to effectively get the wipes apart - they do not pull apart as you take one out. They tend to stick to one another and sometimes I'll get three or more wipes on a pull. If you're changing a wiggly baby or dealing with poop you can imagine how inconvenient this is. Even with the wipe packages that do have the more solid plastic pop top, you still run into this issue.

Like I said - wipes are great and work well but the packaging is not worth the headache.",2
"This started to cause a rash after constant use. Doctor told me this can cause irritations. Also I opened one pack and it had completely molded. I am having better luck just using reusable wipes and just plain water and dry wipes afterwards.",2
"They smell like a dirty dish towel. Wasn’t expecting that.
Other than that… they do what they need to.",2
"This is my fav brand of wipes but the ad shows they come with top and instead they just have a sticker on them making it very Difficult to preserve! So frustrating I bought a big box of these and none have proper lids",2
"these wipes weren't very wet they were kinda dry as if they had been sitting in the warehouse for a couple years or something and also i thought it was weird that a few of them weren't the flip top, a few of them were the refills that don't have a reclosable top",2
"4 packs out of 12 packs do not have the lids/openings. And they are not refill packs.",2
"I was very unhappy that four of the packs of wipes from my order were the ones that have no green/blue lids to close the pouch of wipes with. The stick closed version doesn’t work and either continually opens or forces you to buy a wipe dispenser. Please implement some quality control. Where I buy my wipes from is dependent on who gives me a solid case of wipes with the kids on the pouches as advertised. Wipes are good but useless if they dry out .four! Four pouches will be drying o it at my house. Shame on you supplier!",2
"So its not all the time, but we do notice from time to time our baby will get a small rash still. So they are not super soft. Also the bins themselves lose the next wipe a lot. When you pull a wipe, it'll just stop and give you that one, and you have to dig out the next wipe. May not seem like big problem, but when you have a poopy diaper, and you have to hold the butt in the air and try to dig out another wipe while baby is wiggling out like David Copperfield. You'll wish the next one was readily available.",2
"I love these wipes but so frustrated as picture shows a hard top and its a soft flap that looses stickiness overtime!!!",2
"I ordered these and they are supposed to have the plastic lid/close sure but out of all of them 4 came in box that do not have the plastic lid to close. And this is the second time this happened. Not happy.

So just beware!",3
"Bottom packets are without cap. So they get dry easily.

All packets should have cap",3
"I love using these for my grandson. I thought I was doing us a favor when I bought these in bulk like this to last a few months but my wife said when she used them that they fell dryer than the 1s we get at a local store. So I will keep buying but not online.",3
"They tear off easily and are not useable.",3
"These came without lids on some of them? So the tops of the packages tore fairly quickly resulting in dried out wipes. Otherwise they were good.",3
"These wipes themselves are great, however the shipment is supposed to be all resealable wipe packages. This is the second time this seller has sent mostly the tape to close kind rather than one with the true plastic lid. The tape resealable ones tear easily and don’t close well, so lots of wipes end up getting dried out and wasted.",3
"If you are changing a diaper with one hand these are impossible to pull out without taking the whole package out like a clown takes a scarf out of a hat",3
"These did not all come with lids. This did not seem clear to me on the description. Returning.",3
"Ok. Cheesy seal. If you wait to long between uses the next one drys out.",3
"Item was received this time; however I was unable to get it out of the mailbox because it too large and stuck. I had to be at the mailbox when they come to put up the mail to get help with getting it out. Otherwise everything else was good.",3
"Four of the twelve received do not have a cap to close & keep fresh; instead they have a reseal. Within three uses the package ripped & the reseal quite sticking. I had a sealable large ziplock available to save the day. Some gave 1 star, but these are hands down the best wipes on the market. Because I have a somewhat operational brain, I was able to successfully adapt for very little cost (one ziplock bag). NTL, Pampers may want to rethink the move from cap that keeps them fresh to plastic resealable… this just doesn’t work.",4
"Only 8 of the 12 come with pop tops and four are the peel and stick plastic tops meant for refills. Description does mention this, but it’s not clear in the picture that this is how this pack of 12 is sold. Not helpful if you are sending these for day care. Also why sell “refills” if the wipe brands no longer sell the hard container of wipes.",4
"After a year using the monthly delivery. This monthly I received missing 4 pack in my box. I got so upset.",4
"love pampers wipes! lasts for a few months with two kiddos and my daughter has sensitive skin and she doesn't break out!",4
"The wipes are good. The packaging is not good. The first few careful and gentle open-and-close routines of the first package out of the whole box simply ripped the access port of the package. Can't be sure if the moisture can retain until I use all wipes in the package. I had to find another container to hold all the wipes from this torn package.",4
"Great wipes. Never had an issue with my baby. Only thing was the last two packs didn’t have to flip top on them.",4
"I didn't realize that a few of these packs of wipes don't have pop tops. It's ok though. Still good for the price. I used to go with Huggies wipes. I've used Amazon wipes before which are good as well. The only thing I don't like about these wipes is that when pulling one out you may get 1, 2, 3 more wipes attached to the one. They seem to be more stuck togetger tham the Highies brand when pulling one out. That can be frustrating to deal with when handling a blowout.",4
"Ordering this is tricky. You have to look very closely (I didn't) at the items. 9 out of 12 had the plastic dispenser top, but three didn't. I will not order these again.",4
"These sensitive wipes have been the best and save my baby's tushie. Slightly frustrated I ordered the 84 (box of 12) and four of the packs do not have the pop top as advertised. The sticker flap rips the wipes packaging when opening so wipes pull out in stuck-together clusters.",4
"Some are just simpler packs that tend to tear, meaning wipes are more likely to dry out.

It would be better value if they all had lids, even for a couple more bucks.",4
"Good buy and nice to always have them available in the house. I use these for personal use, (do not flush). Strong and soft. Great for hand clean-up and grandkids. Will reorder case when necessary.0",5
"I run a daycare. I buy these in bulk and love them. Soft smell. Not rashes. Sturdy wipes. I also collect the points from wash individual wipe pack!",5
"Feel soft. And last longer than other wipe",5
"I have been using these specific wipes since we had our first child! They hold up well, love the softness of them, and the thickness! You don’t have to worry about it ripping or your finger poking through when wiping. I repurchase this time and time again. I will say the last box I received about half of the box had no flip top attached. Which was fine with me since I can just use those to refill our wipes warmer. That was the only time that that has happened though! They usually always all come with the flip top, perfect for travel!",5
"These wipes are perfect for baby skin and come in best and easy packaging. I love that Amazon sells these in this bulk amount for cheeper than the grocery stores smaller packs. Awesome product for me and my babies!",5
"We gave a case of these wipes to our neighbors for their newborn. Most people gave them pretty things but they were very grateful for something practical!!!",5
"So mich better than huggies. Was buying huggies for years, pampers are softer, and more moist!",5
"These wipes are perfect for sensitive skin. My son's skin gets easily irritated with other wipes. We subsribe and save so that it ships montly.",5
"I like these wipes less expensive to order online then buy in store.",5
"Had a baby shower got these for Lady She very much appreciated",5
"We bought this teether for our 4 month old and like other toys, we purchased it based on the marketing of it being made using a ""safe"" material. We wrongfully assumed that like all the other silicone baby products we use (other teethers and pacifiers) would advise boiling in order to sterilize. When the product arrived it came with no instructions...we reflexively washed it with soap and boiled it for a couple minutes prior to first use. We noticed a strange smell after boiling, again just for a couple minutes, prompting us to read the fine print on the back of the packaging...which states declaratively ""do not boil"" ... based on the smell which I'd described as an unpleasant ""chemical"" smell that's vaguely reminiscent of what I've smelled when melting waxes and mixing paints years ago for craft projects... we decided not to give it to our baby. We'll return it with the questions a) why not clearly state not to boil the product in a prominent place to prevent this predictable consumer action and b) for the material scientists out there...what's the implication of a silicone product not being able to safely withstand boiling water (perhaps that's not a safe statement based on the company's statement not to boil) ? Really disappointed that purchasing a product that gets so close to a developing baby is not more clearly and straightforwardly labeled...obviously it's highly reviewed here on this platform so not discounting other's experiences with the product and not trying to cause alarm. Maybe it's common knowledge that's evaded me that some silicone can be boiled and others cannot but both are equally safe? If so, that would be great to learn!",1
"The teether is cute however it has a chemical smell that I can’t wash off. The reason for only 1 star is that this can’t be boiled or placed in the dishwasher. So it will never be sanitized. That doesn’t make sense to me, it’s a baby toy made by a manufacturer who specializes in baby toys.
I posted a picture directly from the sellers page. Which states using a sponge or wipe to “clean” the teether. Sponges are not sanitary which isn’t usually a big deal unless your talking about a baby under the age of 1. As a mother im disappointed and wish I would have done more research before trusting this seller. Lesson learned.",1
"It's hard to hold for my baby who is 9 month now its helping at all I wish it would vibrate on its own instead a baby has to really bite hard on it to vibrate and it makes them hurt so it's not worth it at all",1
"I read the reviews and was excited about this product for my teething baby. I couldn’t figure out how to work it at first, thinking it needed batteries. I couldn’t believe how HARD you have to bite on this in order to make it vibrate. How is a small, teething child supposed to use this easily to help sore gums? The device works, but I don’t get how a child would be able to use it independently.",1
"Changed batteries n still won't vibrate",1
"I don't love this. The only part that vibrates is one corner of the leaf which if I knew that I wouldn't have bought it. It is also hard to make vibrate. The middle apple part is hard plastic, the outer red part is silicone so easy for the baby to hold.",1
"Too hard, baby hates it",1
"It is very very hard My baby hit his gum on it and it bled!!! It is impossible for a baby to get it to vibrate I even had a hard time getting it to do it! DO NOT GET THIS FOR YOUR BABY. It has to be one of the hardest “teething” toys I have ever felt!!",1
"I received this tether in the mail this afternoon. I’ve been waiting all weekend and was so excited for three month old who has been teething like a mad man. Only to be thoroughly disappointed to open up this teether in its original packaging that is taped ( scotch tape) down to the sides and on the bottom like it was already opened obviously used. There is even dirt and hair in the tape.
I paid for a brand new, unopened item, and got this. I will not be handing in it to my child to put in his mouth. I would like a complete refund or brand new item that I paid for.",1
"I bought this early for my baby. When she was 4 months old and she hates it. First of all it’s not even soft and chewy. It’s hard. I thought teething toys are supposed to be soft and chewy so the gums feel good. Anyways. I don’t recommend. What I do recommend is the mushroom teether (that looks like a nipple) baby loves that one",1
"The vibration is only in the top leaf part. The toy is very hard and doesn’t seem comfortable for baby gums :( A baby would have to bite down pretty hard to get the vibrations going, so I have to hold down the vibration button found on the one spot on the leaf top just so my baby can feel it. I would NOT recommend this product for your little one unfortunately. I gave two stars because it is easy for my 5month baby to hold.",2
"Although the concept of this teether is wonderful I feel as though it may be a little to hard for my baby’s little gums.",2
"My baby was not interested in this teether at all. The vibrating feature does not work well with baby unless they are pressing hard on leaf. I do not understand how this is a teether, the material is easy too tough.",2
"Hard for baby to hold. Cute, but my baby doesn’t care for it.",2
"I thought the whole apple was going to vibrate, not just the stem. A little confusing for my 8m old to figure out that just the top vibrates",2
"My daughter isn’t strong enough to activate the vibration. I thought you would be able to turn it on and off.",2
"When I purchased this it was mainly to give our baby something to chew on, outside of her hands, feet and everything else in her reach. As a first time parent wasn't sure what to buy but this seemed like a good start. Luckily I bought this and another from elsewhere to test the options. Our baby is 5m+, no teeth yet, she prefers the other option. This is not very chewy. Definitely hard and sturdy, will last long though. I will put it down for her to try later when her teeth come in.",2
"The toy itself is very cute, fits fairly well in a baby's hands and has nice nubby surfaces to chew. Unfortunately the carrot was still a little large for my 4-month-old to fit in his hands/mouth. The real disappointment is that the toy smells strongly--like an air freshener. In the item description, it mentions it being a multi-sensory toy but fails to mention the scent. Had I known it was scented, I would not have purchased it.",2
"The two stars is not because it is a bad product, I just think shapewise and dimensionally wise for my kid and at what development stage she is currently at, it seems to be a bit awkward for him to get a decent hold of it from any end of this carrot, to get a stable set up to where he can chew on it for a reasonable amount of time. We have several other chew toys for my kid and dimensionally they are much better for my kid to grasp and to chew uncomfortably. This is purely a subjective outside perspective review based on what I observed in my four month old child who has two and now going on three teeth",2
"Cute but not letting my dr have it. Package was previously opened and taped closed",2
"My child’s occupational therapist suggested this kind of sensory toy to deliver extra input to his mouth, so I tried it. The pricing was very fair and reasonable, which is why I started with this model rather than more expensive options. Only one part of the apple leaf vibrates, and that’s only if it’s bitten by an individual with precise pressure in a particular location. I would have preferred more points of this sensory tool to vibrate or perhaps not require as much pressure. My toddler is able to operate this far more efficiently than my 9month old son, who it was intended for. My 9 month old can get it to work on occasion, but more often than not just gets frustrated with it.",3
"Really cute, baby doesn’t love it but does like it. It was a bit smelly at the beginning when I first opened the package. Comes just as looks on pics.",3
"Sensory part didn’t work, but the baby loved it and they refunded my money and didn’t make me send it back to them! So excellent customer service",3
"I thought the material would be a bit more soft. My baby didn't like it.",3
"My teething baby doesn’t always like it, can’t reach the needed spots probably",3
"I can say it’s too hard for Little baby, give it to babies who have tooth already",3
"There is nothing wrong with this product. My baby simply didn’t like it. The side handles with the green stem is too thick for her hands to hold. She’s 5 mons at the moment, but starting teething @ 4 mos. My item arrived packaged well and didn’t smell bad. Of course I washed it immediately and tested her. I’ll keep it around just in case it grows on her as teeth come in.

There’s this little penguin that infant hands go through the bottom. We find that to be a better fit for us. My daughter can chew on the sides w/ these little knobs that resemble a n1pple.",3
"Too tough for my baby to bite on to get it to vibrate. My baby still gnawed on it, though.",3
"Got it for our baby doesn’t care for it too much. Is easy to hold for him though",3
"My daughter is 4 months and it’s too big for her. Weight is also too much for babies.",3
"Bought this for the baby because she’s at the age of putting everything in her mouth. This is so cute and the handles really help her grasp it. It’s got a good weight to it as well. One thing I don’t like about it is how easily it attracts lint once it falls out of baby’s hands. I have to constantly rinse it off because it will pick up the slightest lint.",4
"I have a 4 month old baby and she is starting to teeth. I must say, I was very excited for this product after reading all the reviews, but was sad when we put it to the test and she didn't show much interest in the carrot. She didn't really want to hold it and it seemed like it was too heavy for her to hold up on her own. I had to hold it in her mouth as she cried and screamed.

Just not the best experience. I'm leaving 4 stars in hopes that maybe when she's bigger, she'll like this product.",4
"It’s a little too heavy for my 3/4 month old who likes to put everything in his mouth but will be cute for Easter. Maybe he will like it when he’s a little older.",4
"Cute for a Easter addition",4
"I didn’t realize the vibration feature is powered via pressure on one of the apple leaves (for example pinching or biting). For now I have to engage the vibration and hold it for baby to enjoy but one day maybe I won’t be needed for baby to use it.",4
"A great option for tether for baby! Super cute too. The handles make it easy for baby to hold on to",4
"My child loves it….",4
"Love the size and design of this teether but my 4 month old found this a little “hard” and would cry at times when he was biting it as it hurt his gums.",4
"Grandson liked!",4
"Pretty big but the handles come in handy, it’s also really firm so will work well for babies that attack with their little gummies.",4
"Baby’s favorite toy to chew on. Easy to hold. Perfect size and shape. Bought a second one after seeing how feat this was- afraid of losing the first one. Have given as baby gifts. Highly recommend.",5
"Very colorful, durable, easy to clean. Must feel good to chomp on them because he seems to favor these above all his teething items. His favorite is the corn one.",5
"My teething granddaughter loves to hold this little gem and bite on it. Very easy for her to hold!",5
"I love the feeling of it. It’s soft but hard enough for it to be a good teether. The size is nice for baby to hold too",5
"Easy to hold and has two teething ends for the baby. Small and soft and very easy to wash.",5
"I was having a hard time trying to find age appropriate gifts for my baby for Easter. I happened to see the Infantino Carrot Teether while doing some online shopping and purchased it right away. This product is adorable and seems to be made of high quality materials. I am highly pleased with my purchase.",5
"This little teether is perfect for an Easter basket! It’s got texture and is easy for your little one to grip!",5
"This is perfect for little hands and fingers to grab a hold of and chew on. It helps massage their little gums that are starting to grow new teeth.",5
"This little carrot is perfect for the little 8 month old I nanny for. I keep it in the fridge for that little extra cooling",5
"Not only this item is of a good rubbery material but of great quality. It is also perfect in teaching your baby to hold items and identify the type of vegetable (learning tool)",5
"I usually buy pampers for my daughters but I ran out. I was gifted some Huggies in the size N. They didn’t bother my girls so I thought they would be fine when I ran out of diapers and the only store near had Huggies and Luvs. So I opted for the Huggies. I was dropping them off at my mothers for the weekend. I went online to purchase more diapers and saw that the Huggies cost less so I ordered them. I dropped them on Friday and picked them up on Sunday. Before I left on Sunday I noticed one of the girls had a little diaper rash. They are turning 5 months in a few days and we have not ever had this happen. It was a small nickel sized rash. I thought maybe my mom fell asleep and took too long to change her. I get home, treated it. Used up the last few pampers we had and started to use the box of Huggie I ordered. Twin A’s rash went away. I never even thought that maybe it was the diapers until the next day after we started using the Huggie Twin B’s entire booty had a rash. Now I have a huge box of diapers that I can not use. My daughters do not have sensitive skin and I change them regularly. I could not believe it. I’m sticking with Pampers from here on.",1
"I purchased size 6 Huggies 120 count 3 times in the past so I went to my purchasing history and clicked on my previous purchase. I decided to purchase size 5 this time so I clicked on size 5. It REDIRECTED to the '50' count instead of staying on the '120' count. The price of a 120 count compared to a 50 count is $6.84 more. $42.03 vs. $48.87. Who in their right mind wouldn't spend $6.84 for 70 more diapers. THIS IS A BLATANT SCAM!!! The fact that it AUTOMATICALLY switched me from 120 to 50 is what is outrageous.
You would think that a company like Huggies would not conduct business in this manner knowing that the are many young people trying to just provide for their children without being deceived by a multi million dollar corporation. SHAM ON HUGGIES!!! I will never buy from this RIP OFF company ever again and neither should you!!!",1
"These are terrible diapers i wish i could get a refund they keep leaking every single time almost. We've been using this box for about a month and 8 out of 10 diapers on baby will leak we've had to continually wash clothes after clothes doing additional washes for the constant leaks. I literally just had a leak and came on here to buy different diapers and took a moment to write this review. Please DO NOT BUY THESE.",1
"I have bought this item/brand since newborn stage and I am very pleased EXCEPT for this box… it’s like the machine cut off the mark. It’s too short. This is a diaper from the old box, remainder are in my diaper bag the other is the new box. It’s missing the top ~1/2in. The band of fastened straight can touch the skin and rub, there’s no buffer of material.

Is the product still functional? Yeah.

Do I have to be extra careful? Yeah bc the strips are rough on his skin. Also bc he’s a heavy wetter and I feel like there’s less protection. I’ve been changing more frequently than normal in case it leaks at the top.

Just wanted to send this out in case anyone else has this issue!",1
"0 stars! So i have to say that the new pooh/eeyore diapers they just released are complete trash. Not only did they push the price up they cut the number of diapers you get. (We would go through about 250-300 diapers a month). I have 18 month old twins a girl 19 pounds and boy 25 pounds. In have been using little snugglers since they came out of nicu and never had a problem with the older diapers. These new ones are terrible after a 45 minute nap she's soaked through. If it manages not to leak like a sieve in a hour the diaper starts seeping through and again leaving the clothes damp. Night time in these is not an option at all i was up all night every 45 to 60 mins changing diapers! My husband thought i was exaggerating so.... he got them on his day off all by himself. Half a day later he was on his way to get diapers at the grocery store.... and came home with every diaper not huggies.... i couldnt get them all in the photo my dinner table had been taken over by diapers.... Talked to huggies to see if there maybe was something wrong with the box I received was told to put them in next size up and guess what? Leaked even worse because in have a 19 pound toothpick in a sail. Thanks huggies.... In my opinion the crappy grocery store diapers hold way better and are a quarter of the cost. Cancelled my subscription and will never use these again. Still have about 130 of them left was thinking donating them but i dont want someone to be as miserable as i was! Huggies i understand keeping costs low but when you deal in baby products you can't cut corners..... how unethical can you be?",1
"Have been using the pack of diapers from the right. The ones ordered on Amazon are on the left. Now I have two boxes of 156 diapers that are not going to fit because they are built like a size 2 but say size 3",1
"Beware of broken, unsafe products to use with your baby.
We got this package last week and I have had at least 10 diapers with loose/ broken wings and an oily substance where the glue should have been?
Beware",1
"I have been using the regular edition model for my baby and they were very good. But since 2 months the new default edition are not good at all for some reason.

Issues
1. Leaks are happening
2. Filling capacity is reaching very quickly compared to the regular model.
3. Quality, touch and feel were not good at all compared to the regular model.
4. Thread fabric is Getting damaged easily

Pictures shown

The left side one's are old model, which are very good.
Right side one's are the new 100 years disney edition model which were not good at all.",1
"I don't know what's wrong
I have a twins and i was using Kirkland, Huggies and pampers for them
They have never had any booty rash or redness till we bought Huggies from amazon
There was something wrong so my wife suggested to cut it out and change the diaper brand to make sure that the problem is the diaper and it was !!!!!",1
"We just had a really bad experience with these that we ordered from Amazon and just wanted to warn people.

I started smelling a strong bad odor every time my 6 month old daughter had a wet diaper. Since we always use Huggies we assumed it must be her urine and that she must have a UTI or something. She was also getting diaper rashes and seemed fussier than normal so we Brought her to the pediatrician yesterday. They gave her a catheter to extract urine to check for UTI.

I randomly had a thought to try a Pampers diaper on her today since we had some to just make sure it was actually her pee that was giving off the odor. Once that diaper was wet It just smelled normal and like pee.

I just took one of the unused Huggies and poured water on it and got the horrible smell again right away. Almost smells like nail polish remover or something.

I feel like a horrible mom for not figuring this out sooner but there is something wrong with this batch of diapers we got from Amazon. Will not be ordering diapers from here again",1
"Little snugglers size 1-2 have the dotted liner (officially called GentleAbsorb® Diaper Liner) which keeps the surface very dry. HOWEVER, from size 3, they no longer have this liner. So the surface is wet and no longer dry as it used to be.

Little snugglers is also thinner than Little snugglers plus, and it gives my baby rashes that she never had in 7 months. I do not recommend this diaper.",2
"Newborn and size one are amazing. Size 2 and up have weird, scratchy, purple tabs that break out baby’s skin and the sides aren’t even. They seem to run smaller than other brands I’ve tried too. They also don’t last well overnight. Baby almost always soaks through. The inside isn’t as soft as smaller sizes either. Overall unimpressed with these. Once your little is bigger than a size 1 I do not recommend.",2
"Bought this big pack in size 1 I’ve bought them from target in the 96count size and these aren’t the same. They don’t seem as soft, even though this has the same description and it’s Winnie the Pooh design is different.",2
"My infant leaked through overnight and wet his whole inside and the bed. These are not the same quality as the Huggies I get in the actual store . They do not hold liquid very well and they just seem like the quality again isn’t the best. I’ll continue to buy mines out of target",2
"The quality of these diapers was very bad. Every single one ripped and tore and left strings and fabric that got entangled around my child's waistline and worst-case private areas. We ended up finding every single one in the 96 pack exhibited this issue. Won't buy from here again.",2
"Almost every one of the 128 diapers would snag large amount of material and wrap around a body part of my preemie grandson when to changing. We used Huggies a few years ago for my other grandson and they were amazing. This batch my grandson feels the wetness immediately. I am extremely dissatisfied with this size 1 batch.",2
"Im a first time parent and am experimenting with some brands of diaper for my baby. I have tried kirkland , pampers, huggies so far.

KIRKLAND
Kirkland diapers are the cheapest and if you can find it on a deal it's super cheap. The absorption of liquid is very good. And I have never spotted a leak from that. But those diapers have some design prints in the outside which is in blue color. It greatly confuses if the diaper has turned blue or yellow. Another drawback I found is the adhesive flap immidiately sticks to the inside of the diaper and makes it difficult to roll it for disposal. So I'd rate it 5/10

HUGGIES
These diapers have the same type of adhesive flaps as kirkland ones. It doesn't seem to be that big of a problem, But the diaper gets swollen even before it is half full and baby starts feeling very uncomfortable on a single pee. Also the inside of the diapers has embossed pattern which makes imprints on the baby's skin.It has leaked once!! I wonder what solely is the purpose of a diaper So to me Huggies is a big 'No' . I'd rate 3/10

PAMPERS
So far it is the best. The adhesive flaps are broad enough and elastic. The sticky tape is colored yellow, this is very helpful when changing diapers in the night light.
It has no prints to confuse with the blue line.
It also doesn't has any pattern. And pampers occupies less space than the other two I tried.
And that's the sole reason it's a bit more pricey than others but I'd say it's totally worth it!
9/10",2
"Usually we like the huggies brand however not this time. Unsure if it was just a fluke box or what but every diaper we have used so far becomes extremely stringy when we take it off our baby. As soon as we un stick the flaps it pulls a bunch of string out and it gets caught around our baby's leg. Honestly afraid to buy these again, hopefully it's just a fluke box.",2
"I start by saying I love Huggies… these were the only diapers my son (now grown) could use without getting a rash… However, the last batch (our first size 2…) we got from our daughter was lacking in quality.
I am concerned that Amazon is selling the “deffective batches” to us customers to maintain the great prices.

These are the major issues we encountered:

1) the diapers were “small”: I had just finished a pack of pampers gifted to us…and noticed the Huggies same size a LOT smaller… I thought it might just be a difference in products except that from time to time I would get a bigger Huggies in the same bag

2) the straps were facing up in some. Some of the diapers were defective… the strap were facing up instead of sideways which basically made the diaper very difficult to use

3) most diapers would rip on the edge when I stretch them … for the first time after 3 kids (my youngest is 5mos) I have issues with Huggies ripping

4) for the first time I see silica residue on my baby’s skin

Absorbency: Cannot complain… the diaper holds quite a bit

Sensitive skin: the diaper does not fit as well due to the deffective cuts and sometimes my baby’s skin is red where the edges of the diaper touches (never had this issue before)

Leak protection: Again, the diaper is small and odd with the straps not quite facing to the sides which makes it a bit difficult to put on… it may be I am guilty of not placing the diaper correctly sometimes and thus the leaks…",2
"I have loved Huggies Little Snugglers since my daughter was in the preemie size specifically for the inside layer that looks like little dots and wicks away moisture super well. Even when they are near full, they usually still feel dry to the touch. I ordered these size 3’s when my baby sized up and the inner liner was not the usual one even though the picture states it would be. They do not wick away moisture like the other ones. I live in Haiti and had to have these transported in from my mailing box in Florida so I couldn’t even send them back. I’m not sure if it’s a fluke but I’m very disappointed and would not order these again if that’s how they all are. Super bummed.",2
"I’ve tried these in years past and liked them, but they’ve of course changed the design and makeup of the diaper layers/materials. I’m not a fan now. The inside layer that’s closest to baby’s skin will separate from the rest of the diaper if wet for any amount of time. And overnight use of these Little Snugglers is not an option. They leak with my child that sleeps between 10-12 hours straight. We will stick with Swaddlers from here on out.",3
"These diapers are great for my son. They fit well, they don't give him rashes, and they move well with him (he's an active 16 month old). That said, I had to start buying them elsewhere. I started with the subscribe and save, but the diapers never came on time. I even got a giant box of tissues instead of diapers at one point, which was a pain because I had to return them in order to get the correct order. The subscribe and save option was supposed to make things easier, but since it didn't work, I just get my diapers at the store now instead.",3
"Box was open when received",3
"I loved Huggies for the first few months but once my babies were older I stopped using them because they just didn’t hold pee well. I felt like my kids were leaking out every few hours. Like I said, loved them the first few months, and would use again for the first few months, but something about their bigger diapers doesn’t work for me.",3
"It’s been 5 years since we’ve last needed these diapers, and they’re not as good as I remember. They do hold everything in pretty well… we’ve not had major blowouts or leaky diaper issues, but taking the side clasps off during changes causes the diaper to fray a lot. This is an issue because the stringy stuff gets in our baby’s leg creases and could potentially get wrapped around his sensitive bits. We’ve managed to catch all the loose pieces before they became an issue, and I’ve learned to run my finger under to collect most of it before the diaper change, but it’s annoying.",3
"Not the worst Huggies, but I have been through almost every type and I’m always disappointed. Pampers pure is our favorite. These diapers do not absorb as well and my son is always red. Here is my personally made up scale:

Pampers pure: can change every 4-5 hours with no redness, probably longer Bc night time we don’t do a change and he is never red. They also hold more and don’t feel as heavy when very full. The diapers in general feel like a soft and thick paperish material. They feel naturally made. Also a bit more room for bigger babies.

Huggies Tigger: change every 3 hours maximum. They feel full and heavy at that point. Sometimes redness. Diaper in general feels silky, inside is thicker silky feel. Does not feel natural.

Huggies Mickey: change every hour, max 2. Usually red. Diapers feel wet on the outside and are very heavy. Diaper in general is silky. Reminds me of a cheaper Sams members mark. (I’d buy sams over these if I had to, they are a bit better). They are so yucky feeling when I change them, I am sure my son feels it too. I maxed out my budget of diaper cream when I used these.

Hello Bello: I love these Bc they are adorable. They feel as close to pampers pure as I have found. They are a little more expensive though. They have a slight silk feel, but the natural paper feel that pure offers is present. I can leave my son in these as long as pure with out redness. When full they feel kind of like Huggies Tigger but not as heavy.

I hope this helps someone. I’m over spending money on diapers that aren’t well made and I hate how hard it is for parents to avoid spending a fortune without disappointment. The only compliment I can give huggies is that they do hug the body and fit sung. If you have a tiny baby I think the fit would be better looking than pure. But the feel and make is horrible,so I still wouldn’t recommend. If they would use more natural materials they could compete because of the nice fit. With that said, I have yet to try their Huggies Special Delivery. The reason being, they are pricier than Pampers Pure. Since I love the pure and huggies has let me down so many times, I can’t rationalize taking yet another gamble on huggies.",3
"Really love huggies but all these diapers in this pack are doing this. Thought it was the way I was putting on the diaper until my husband brought it up this morning. Really annoying cause I’ve never had diapers do this and this is my second kid",3
"I don’t like when I remove the right strap to change the diaper that it pulls the fuzzy stuff up to where I need to use my other hand and pull it apart. It’s like the Halloween spider web stuck to the strap. This doesn’t happen with the other diapers I used. Maybe it’s just this entire batch or that I bought it from Amazon. Idk but it’s extremely annoying.",3
"I only bought Huggies for ny son at one point. Then I noticed they didn’t fit his chunky thighs so we had to go with another brand.",3
"I don’t like that these diapers shed “hairs.” It is not good to have to pick off fibers every time you change a diaper. They hold the urine just fine and it doesn’t explode or have those weird beads that some diapers have when there is a full diaper. They fasten fine, but the shedding fibers is a deal breaker for me.",3
"These fit SOO MUCHHH butter than the pamper size 1. My baby got chunky legs and these fit right around. The pamper size 1 doesn’t go around as nice.
These Also feel comfy and less “crinkle crunchy”",4
"Overall I love Huggies diapers, they are often my go-tos. My only complaint is they do tend to run a little smaller than some which is nice when your baby first transitions to the next size up but quickly starts to seem small which leads to more blowouts. Overall though, I recommend.",4
"I ordered To use for my 3-4lb yorkie and they was too small but would probably work good for an actual baby",4
"I like how these diapers are for babies and one of the better brands . Only thing that sucks is how expensive they are",4
"These are the only diapers from the Huggies line that my daughter has leaked out of. I like the double security on the tabs though. I will definitely stick to Huggies little movers, as they have better absorbency than these.",4
"It’s the perfect size for my daughter, but even with the tricks folding down the back, pulling out the leg nets. I still get peed on. So far they are the only diaper I like.",4
"Like",4
"I try some of them and this ones are the best in my opinion. I bit expensive but perfect for the baby.",4
"What's not to like in a good Huggy",4
"Bought these for my son he isnt here yet but i cant wait to use them",4
"I absolutely love these Huggies Size 2 diapers! They are so soft and gentle on my baby's skin, and they keep her dry and comfortable all day and night. The fit is perfect and the stretchy waistband ensures a secure yet comfortable fit.

The cute designs are an added bonus, and the packaging is convenient and easy to use. The 180 count pack is great value for the price, and I appreciate that it comes in 3 separate packs for easy storage.

Overall, I highly recommend these Huggies Little Snugglers diapers to any parent looking for a reliable and high-quality diaper for their little one. Thank you, Amazon, for always providing great products like these!",5
"These diapers are great! They’re soft, cute, and absorbent. They also fit so well around adorable chunky baby thighs and aren’t boxy like some other diaper brands.",5
"My Absolute favorite! It’s so soft and really doesn’t let anything leak out. From all the Huggies diaper lines this one is the most plush and definitely worth it. Never gave my baby a rash or a blow out.",5
"These diapers are great for my baby and super absorbent, good deal for the price too",5
"My twins love Huggies ❤️ they are leak proof and they don't cause rashes which is amazing when they both seem to have sensitive skin.",5
"We find these to secure so much easier, it’s easy to check for poops and restrap again if needed unlike other brands. They’re soft, but fitted well around the legs and have a nice cut around the baby’s bellybutton. We’ve tried various diapers in the first month thinking on was causing diaper rashes versus the other and do not feel that any diaper has contributed more than another.",5
"Searching for new born diapers for our granddaughter. These came quickly & worked great, until stebout grew them.",5
"I have two children and with my first child I personally did not like Huggies diapers. I thought that every time that the child use them you could smell it and it was just terrible... Flash to now with my new baby. Huggies has 100% stepped up their game. I love the little poo flap in the back. I love that they don't smell bad when the child pees (because they used to). They are super soft and super comfy. These are definitely worth the extra money compared to the baby dry Huggies or whatever the basic version is.",5
"I’ve tried several other diapers, but with both kids, always come back to these. The extra “pocket” at the top back saved us many outfit changes. I dubbed that the poo pocket. Make sure when putting them on to first run your fingers up the bag to make sure the pocket is “open”. These also always seemed to be the best leak protection around the leg holes for us. Worth paying a bit more if it saves me time and effort on laundry and leaks. We have these on subscribe and save to get the best value. Both my kiddos were sensitive to some diapers and we never had bad reactions to these.",5
"I would purchase these 1000x over! Being a first time mom I never thought I would say I have a favorite diaper brand, but what do you know! These diapers are soft, they hold a lot and are gentle on my baby girls skin!",5
"We absolutely *LOVED* these wipes for the past almost 3 years (our daughter is almost 3)! They have been the primary wipe for our daughter for HER ENTIRE LIFE. She has not minded them AT ALL, that right there is the ultimate ""seal of approval"" in my mind. The only other wipes we ever used were the Pampers Sensitive Skin wipes for bulk poop removal, the rest of the genital cleaning and general daily mouth wipes, hand wipes, etc., were exclusively Water Wipes.

We would have friends & family members, who did not know about Water Wipes, start to object when we would go to wipe her mouth after eating, saying ""oh you can't do that, the chemical smell is so yucky on the mouth"" and after they would use one they would basically be stunned at how AWESOME the Water Wipes were!

However, something changed with our April ""subscribe and save"" order: yes, there's a new look, who cares about that, but there is a SMELL!!!! A really weird, off-putting smell. Our daughter said ""those are different, they smell, yuck!"". Seriously, that is a direct quote from a 34 month old human being (incidentally, the most honest & trustworthy human being I know!).

It truly makes us sad, seriously sad, to have to downgrade the star rating because these wipes used to be soooo wonderful, I would, and did, recommend them with ZERO reservation. Now, I simply cannot do that, and that's really a bummer.

Thank goodness we got screwed up on our rotation of boxes after moving into our new house and the newest ones were opened while we still have two boxes of the ""old"" ones, whew! At least we have some time to shop around while still having a small supply of the absolute *best* wipes ever: the 'original' Water Wipes.

I just counted how many Water Wipes we have purchased through Amazon since 2019: 8,100 wipes prior to the last batch of 540 ""new"" ones. That does not include the close to ten or so 540-ish-count boxes we bought from Walmart or had gifted to us. I don't know if that number is high or low, but it is what we have purchased and it seems like a decent amount to me and we have ZERO regrets about the purchases, on the contrary, they've been some of the best baby oriented purchases we've made! They kept our daughter safe and clean and that is truly priceless and means everything to us.

Please, PLEASE, bring them back and we will be more than happy to chalk it up to a bad corporate decision, or perhaps a manufacturing issue? We would be delighted to let bygones be bygones and have our 'old' wipes back for our daughter!",1
"These deserve zero stars. I've been buying these Water Wipes for camping for several years. They used to be strong, substantial wipes, and it was nice to know they were chemical free. Now they are flimsy and smaller by at least a third. They are smaller than a kleenex -- so small they're hard to handle, but they're so thin they have to be folded at least in half to use, which makes using them ridiculous. They are so thin you can see actual pinholes in them. That's right, there are places in the wipes where there is LITERALLY NOTHING between your hand and human poop.

This company took a good product and made it practically useless so they could increase their profits. That's just sad. I don't know why they think customers will continue to buy their brand but I won't. I'll be finding another brand of clean, chemical free wipes to buy that actually protects my hands from poop.",1
"We used to like this product. This is the only wipes that we can use on my son who has eczema without him having breakouts. Of course, we also used it when we had our daughter after a couple of years. But after less than year of using it on my daughter, I noticed a couple of changes. The newly delivered box of this wipes is different. The wipes do not have subtle smell anymore. You can distinctly smell chemicals in it. Also, the wipes feel rougher. And worst is, my daughter GOT RASHES from it. I gave it another chance and did not cancel the subscription. I just used the wipes to clean the house. The next delivery is still the same. So, I just canceled the subscription. I guess you’ll never know the changes unless you’ve been using it for a long time.",1
"As many others have noted, something has gone awry with these wipes. They now have a strong medicinal smell - and the material they're made of is different too - thinner and somewhat textured. The smell is my main concern. These changes are evident in my last two orders -- all came with the new packaging that says ""New Look, Same Purity"". It's more than a new look though, and I emailed the company to inquire -- waiting to hear back. Meanwhile, their website indicates the product is now biodegradable and attributes the new smell and texture to the change in material and process that makes the product biodegradable. So maybe it's a good thing, but it's hard to get past that smell. For now I'm looking into options for trying something else.

7/29/22 Update:
I heard back from the company and they assured me the changes are only in the material. It's now 100% viscose - plastic-free - where it used to be 20% viscose and 80% polyester . So that's good. And that accounts for the change in the texture, size, and sense of the wipes being a little dryer - although apparently if you squeeze the wipe it'll emit the same amount of moisture as the old wipes - as seen in a video about the changes shown on their website. I'm good with all that in the name of being plastic-free. Upon closer inspection though, I see now what others have reported - that the product has trace amounts of Benzalkolium chloride. Turns out this is not new... it's listed on a package I have from before the change and also on the new packaging. I never noticed it before, and never noticed the smell before either. So maybe it's more evident or I'm more sensitive to it with the new material. Btw, the reference to the trace amount Benzalkolium chloride is easy to miss... especially on the new packaging where it's on the back side under the flap where the package is folded and sealed. At this point I've read enough about Benzalkolium chloride to move me to try something new.",1
"Usually, when companies change a product, they make it better. Not in this case. The product I used to love is not the same anymore. The company has completely destroyed a quality product. We deserve answers. If the company wants my business again, they better go back to the old design.

I was surprised to receive the ""new look"" packaging through my subscribe and save subscription. The packs looked smaller and there was a unique undesirable chemical-like smell that I hadn't noticed before. The towels are also harder to pry apart from each other. You can't dispense individual wipes anymore. They stick to each other and you end up just grabbing a big chunk out at a time. This is extremely hard to coordinate when you are also working with a fussy baby that is moving around. I end up taking a bunch of wipes out in big groupings and have to again stuff them back into the package. This is clearly not very sanitary. We should be able to dispense one wipe at a time as we used to previously. The texture of the wipes also used to be very soft--but now it's extremely hard and doesn't move very well against human skin, again making the process of wiping and putting on a diaper more cumbersome.

I will not be buying this brand again until they bring back the old design with the old ingredients and makeup of the product. The smell is truly awful. You can't have that smell and then advertise yourself as ""the world's purest baby wipes.""

I rarely leave reviews on products, but I have been so uncomfortable and saddened with the changed product, that I couldn't not. Company leadership take note and please bring back the OLD product. I don't know what you did to change it, but it's not good. You should be making your product better, not worse.",1
"This product has been great for us as we used these for our first child and now with our second. However, the most recent batch we received has a strong 'chemical' smell, almost like chlorine, and we have noticed quite a bit of irritation on both kids skin when using the packs we recently purchased.

Could just be a bad batch, but we had to stop using them this month and switch to an alternative brand as we are nervous to get more of these not knowing if it actually was just a bad batch or if it is a new way they processing them.",1
"I had been using this wipes since my baby’s was born, 2 years ago. I received the latest delivery by subscription and noticed the difference in packing and SIZE for the same price. The wipes are smaller which It might not be a big of a deal but wish te company was straight forward. I also notice a change in the material, it is rough. They still claim they are biodegradable, plastic free and only 2 ingredients but now is just difficult to believe. I also check other reviews and realized other people are noticing a change in smell and some cases of reactions which is going to rethink my decision of continue buying from this brand. With inflation and lots of big companies passing by the losses to its customers in the form of higher prices; it is very disappointing to see that business are lowering the quality of products we, the consumers I had been using this wipes since my baby’s was born, 2 years ago. I received the latest delivery by subscription and notice the difference in packing and SIZE. They are smaller which I might not be a big of a deal but wish te company was straight formula. I also notice a change in the material, it is rough. They still claim they are biodegradable, plastic free and only 2 ingredients but now is just difficult to believe. I also check other reviews and realized other people are noticing a change in smell and some cases of reactions which is going to rethink my decision of continue buying from this brand. Disappointed to have the impression that this business decided to lower the quality of what was an excellent option for consumers. I am guessing that is their way to pass down rises in cost to the consumers.",1
"We've been using Water Wipes for 4 yrs and purchased over 40 cases. The recent new and improved batch is New BUT WORSE! The only benefit to Water Wipes is the fact that it's the purest wipes with just 3 ingredients (Water, Grapefruit extract & Benzalkonium Chloride). The ingredients are hidden under the folded flap of the pkg and the Benzalkonium Chloride is misleadingly listed after 4 lines of int'l text for the word ""contains trace."" Quite misleading that the 3 ingredients aren't listed next to each other and while there are separate translation paragraphs for all other descriptions, the one ""chemical"" used is hidden behind 4 lines of foreign text.
Pros: -Only 3 ingredients
Cons:
-Slightly smaller in size than the previous version (Previous 6.4""x7.3"" vs Current 7""x6.6"")
-about 1 inch or more smaller than most other available brands (other brands 7""-8"", while Water Wipes come in at about 6"")
-Cheap re-sealable lid can be easily ripped and is worse than other brand's hard plastic lids
-Material is rougher than previous version. We noticed 2 previous materials used. There was a short phase where they used a thinner, but softer material similar to Bets & Emy wipes.
-Huge Problem: Drier than previous version
-very light chemical smell

As Water Wipes are priced as a premium wipe, it is disappointing that it solely relies on the fact that it's the purest wipes and ignores creating a well-rounded product. All other qualities are left to meet a normal & acceptable standard, rather than delivering an exceptional product deserving of the best accolades and recommendations. Because there's no other purer wipe, I am forced to accept the inferior quality and recommend these w great hesitation! Bets & Emy is a much better product overall but it's very difficult to find.",1
"I have been ordering this one from Amazon for over a year and I have been always pleased. I have very sensitive skin and I am using those as an adult.
I ordered these in July and finally switched to this new packaging in my bathroom 3 days ago. I could tell right away they felt different and when I smelled them they smelled like alcohol or some chemical. I thought maybe it’s just in my head…
For the last few nights I am waking up in the middle of the night with burning around my anus and electrical shocks down my legs accompanied with stomach aching and nausea. For 2 days I am trying to figure what’s caused it. Changed my diet, ate cleaner, to be woken up with this burning sensation again accompanied by restless feeling all over and nausea. The ONLY thing I changed since this nightmare started is this new wipes I started using.
And the fact this pain is concentrated around my anus is a huge clue. I am generally sensitive to chemicals and if my body is acting out then there must be something real bad in it. My body never lies.
I don’t trust this company anymore. I hope the burning goes away once I stop using it.
I had enough waking up at night in terror. Came here to see if other buyers complain about the same thing, and I am not surprised to find here many others with the same recent dissatisfaction since the packaging changed. I will also say that the day I changed to this new packaging I felt irritation around my anus during the day as well. The night terrors are what really got me wondering.
Please don’t poison your babies and yourselves with this product!!!",1
"I used honest wipes and then switched to kudos wipes because that’s what kind of diaper I use for my son. I switched to these because they seemed like a great alternative and were priced better. Not worth it! They’re smaller, thinner, take up 2x the amount for a dirty diaper job and they don’t clean nearly as well. My son also started breaking out in a little bit of a rash. I’ll be switching back to Honest wipes.",1
"The idea of these wipes is great. In reality, they don’t work well so don’t buy them! They are so hard to get out of the package! You either need someone else getting them out and handing them to you or you need to get out a dozen and leave them around you to use. In the moment of changing a major blowout, these wipes are terrible. I won’t be buying them again, you shouldn’t either!",2
"Most wipes are packaged such that when you pull out one wipe, the next one comes out. Or at the very least, the start of the next wipe is in the middle of the package so you can easily grab one when your baby is squirming and crying on the changing table. Not these wipes. Only one comes out at a time and the start of the next wipe is never in the same place. Not only that but the start of the next wipe is so crammed into the stack that it's impossible to easily find with one hand. I regularly would just grab out a whole bunch out of frustration and eventually I stopped using them altogether. They also smell pretty awful.

Otherwise, they clean butts and are apparently good for baby's skin. But there are plenty of other wipes out there that are and also come out of the package easily and consistently .",2
"The packaging was simple. I opened them up and felt like the wipes were too dry. I was excited about these wipes because I’d gotten a sample of them and LOVED them. The sample packet was perfectly moist, not too much not too little. They say they didn’t change anything about the wipes but these don’t seem like the same wipes because these were very dry feeling to me.",2
"These wipes are too small and too thin. I only used one packet and have many more, but I’m not allowed to do a return on them. The only reason I am giving “2 stars” is because I like the idea of the wipes and I like that there isn’t a smell, but these are ineffective when it comes to actually cleaning your kid from a blowout/any poop.",2
"These wipes do not pull up the next wipe after you remove a wipe. You have to dig in the package to get the next wipe, each time. This is not ideal at 3 am when you are trying to change your newborn and it is taking so much longer to dig out each individual wipe.",2
"Very disappointed in this product. The sheets are very thin so grabbing one from the package is impossible and it probably takes 5 to clean anything. Since I ordered as Amazon Prime, I didn’t realize it was non-refundable. What can I use these to clean? Barbie?",2
"I went to open a new package to place it into our wipe holder for the changing table and noticed this discoloration. Three of the packages were this way. I didn’t know what it was so I threw the three packages away. Frustrating to spend so much money and have to throw it away. The other packages were great for my child’s sensitive skin.",2
"These have a weird chemical smell
To them that I didn’t like. I felt weird using them
Every time. Will not order them again.",2
"I purchased these due to the amount of rave reviews from friends. The wipes themselves are ok, but the packaging is not user friendly. The wipes are hard to grab because the folded tab sticks to the wipe. This causes me to pull out multiple at a time that are all stuck flat together which is extremely frustrating, especially at night when you’re trying to aim for a quick change.",2
"My daughter was born in March 2021. I didn’t want to apply any chemical or toxins on her little body, so we purchased these wipes and have been subscribed to them for over 1 year.

Now, my last box arrived, in June 2022, and, immediately, my partner noticed the wipes smelled like alcohol.

As soon as we opened the flap, we smelled an awful rubbing alcohol smell!

We didn’t want to use them. This is the whole reason why we purchased water wipes and not any other brand.

Now, I’ve been doing more research and went on their website to read about their ingredients. It is so hard to find the complete list of Ingredients on their website!

When I finally found them, their ingredients include “Benzalkonium chloride (BAK).”

They also defend their use of this chemical by stating that other baby products contain this chemical.

I understand they had to change their Ingredients but why can’t they be honest and write it on the actual baby wipes container.

Instead of saying “2 ingredients,” they can easily give the consumer the real list of ingredients.

Lastly, I cancelled my subscription, after 1 year of using this product, because I don’t want products that smell like rubbing alcohol, and the chemical Benzalkonium chloride (BAK) is a toxic chemical. It literally is used in soap and other cleaners. I’m pretty sure that’s not a chemical I want around my baby’s vagina or my nephew’s penis.

Honestly, babies deserve non- toxic, chemical free products.",2
"I love the wipes however, all of my packages had a very thin plastic film on top of the plastic flip “lid” to reseal the package.
There is a film on top that peels off, sometimes right away and if it wouldn’t peel of away the film will fall off later. I have found this thin plastic on the babies feet and couldn't figure out where it was coming from until I saw the other half on the package of wipes. The baby has also been able to pull this thing film off of the wipes package. Because of this thin plastic film I am giving the product 3 stars. I would give 5 stars if the film wasn’t there.",3
"This product is truly great. I used it exclusively for the first two and a half years of my daughter's life. Then I found myself without wipes one day when I needed them and I ran into CVS for some, but they didn't have this brand. I bought Huggies Free and Clear instead. I never went back to these again. Even though I love that they are sensitive, fragrance-free, super soft, all that good stuff; they are SUPER ANNOYING to pull out of the container. I knew this was true before I switched, but I didn't realize a) how easy it could be with another type of dispense or b) how much of a difference this factor would make for me. Our daycare went through these wipes so fast and I couldn't totally understand why - it's b/c you almost always pull out two or three wipes at a time and if you're trying to go quickly (as they are in daycares) you don't have time to separate them out neatly, like you might at home. Even at home, you don't always have that luxury. Anyway, bottom line is the product is great, but they really need to change the way they're packaged/dispensed.",3
"The wipes are great, feel clean, not soapy, no perfume. But!! The package is so bad, the opening is just covered by a sticker, not a solid tab, after about a week of use the sticker will not resist, it will be gone and you’ll have an open wipe pack. If you throw it inside a diaper bag everything else will get wet. If it’s sitting in your bedroom all wipes will become completely dry and useless.",3
"Grabbed a single pack at my local grocery store before I received the larger multipack from Amazon and glad I did, as I will be returning the unopened package to Amazon.

These wipes are more difficult than most other brands to get out of the package. I have to fish for the next wipe every time instead of the next one popping out automatically. This alone is enough to return as I need to be able to get them out one-handed during diaper changes. In addition to this, they also have trace amounts of benzalkonium chloride in them per their packaging. One, I don’t think there is enough preservative to effectively prevent mold/bacteria growth, and two this is not an ingredient I would choose to have even in trace amounts for a product I’m using on a newborn. If they replaced the grapefruit extract/benzalkonium chloride with a better/safer preservative and made the wipes easier to get out I’d reconsider them, but as they are there are better options available.",3
"I have used these wipes for more than 10 months. I just opened a package from a new box and they smell like rubbing alcohol, so strong that it made me light headed. I threw out a package and the others smell the same. I don’t feel good about using these on my baby. What is going on???",3
"Inevitably, you will need a single wipe and you will be disappointed. Why? Because the stars must be perfectly aligned to only pull out a single wipe from these packages, you get at least 2 to 5 minimum per attempt. Your options after are to either just use the huge clump you’ve pulled out for a single booger or to ATTEMPT to shove the extras back into the pack without RIPPING the pack which will cause the pack to leak and dry out if left upside down.

It feels like this fault is by design. These wipes are about 6 cents a piece. If customers are regularly pulling out 1 to 4 extra and just going with it (because often, we have one hand on a child and one hand in the wipes) that booger or diaper change goes from costing 6 cents to costing 12 to 30 cents and that pack of 60 wipes might as well only be a pack of 12 to 30 wipes.

Why doesn’t this product deserve a single star review, then?

This product may be expensive as far as wipes go, BUT if your child has very sensitive skin and you enjoy the convenience of disposable wipes, this is it. They are plastic free. As long as your child isn’t allergic to grapefruit seed extract or water or the wipes’ plant-based material, these wipes are great for allergy sufferers. These wipes are gentle and alcohol and fragrance free.

The product is great, the packaging is terrible and encourages more waste. Perhaps WaterWipes COULD fix that issue…but I don’t foresee a company fixing something that forces consumers to spend more. Let’s face it, a lot of kids that need these wipes can’t use any other wipe without irritation and that means parents are going to just deal with it. Personally, I still buy them until my infants outgrow their VERY sensitive skin phase by around 6 months old and then I switch to Pampers Sensitive; however, if the babies are put on antibiotics or get a diaper rash, they go back to WaterWipes during the treatment time.",3
"I’ve never had a package of wet wipes where it was so difficult to just pull out one wipe. I always struggle and then get two or three out. Very annoying when you have an infant spraying urine and feces everywhere and the wipe is the difference between a east job done a full costume change for you and baby.",3
"The wipes are working good so far but when I got the package all the wipe containers were squished and deformed from packaging. They are very thin but my baby is so sensitive I need something with no ingredients in it.",3
"These water wipes are just ok. Does not clean as effectively as I would have hoped. Stretches out of shape when using them. Difficult to pull out of the plastic wrapping. Outside package difficult to open.",3
"Missing the days of automatic pulling up of virtually all other baby wipes! Also not a huge fan of the opening which is just a hole with a piece of sticky plastic to remove and replace for every use. I like that it’s not loaded with chemicals though.",3
"Like name , water wipes are good having required moisture and smooth while using on baby.
Easy to pull the wipes.
Good quality for the prize",4
"While not the cleanest baby wipe out there, these felt like a good option for the price and convenience.
In the past, I had just used whatever wipes I could get for the cheapest price, but as I’ve become more aware, I knew that wasn’t going to work for me with our new baby. I started researching and settled on water wipes as a good disposable option. I can’t say confidently that they are super clean, but I wanted an option for when I didn’t want to use cloth wipes.
They are very thin, but honestly I haven’t used baby wipes regularly in years, so that doesn’t bother me. If you were making the switch from a thicker wipe to these, I could see that being an issue.
My only true complaint is that they’re actually really annoying to get out of the package, and hard to do one handed. I almost always prep the wipes before I start the diaper change, and then just shove any unused ones back in the package.
We have not had any issues with the wipes drying out (newborn life means using them frequently), but I could see that being an issue if you’re not using them frequently.",4
"These wipes are awesome and I love the clean ingredients, but the packaging is a pain to deal with. Many times a large chunk of wipes come out at a time and makes it difficult when you are changing the baby. I'd recommend getting a different contain to store wipes in if you plan on using these for your kiddo!",4
"We’ve been using these wipes for about a month and our baby has not had any issues with diaper rash or irritated skin. I love that these are fragrance free and they are moist enough to get the job done. However my biggest issue is when you pull a wipe, you only get one. And then you have to dig your fingers in to find the end of the next wipe to pull it out. This is very hard with a wiggly infant. We tried two different wipe dispensers but neither solved the issue. We’re now searching for a wipe that comes out properly (like tissues)",4
"These wipes are very effective in cleaning up quick messes of our toddlers hands/face as well as on the go cleanup at restaurants/stores. It is also effective at wiping marker off my kids hands.
Con: it doesn’t reseal very well, could be better with a seal more like baby wipes.",4
"Love using these over other types of wipes, my baby loves these and clean up the mess perfectly. The packaging suck and pulling out one wipe at a time is not possible, just rip the bag and make your own.",4
"Overall it is great product given that aren't many options when it comes finding a chemical free wipe. The only issue is it is kind of hard to pull wipe sheets out from the package.",4
"I was looking to try a new type of baby wipe (for my own use, which I keep by my toilet), and after finding that other wipes often caused irritation to my skin.

So far, this brand seems much better. I like the fact that it's 99% WATER.

However, the downside is that this particular wipe is very 'flimsy' and doesn't work as well for actual 'wiping'. The wipe doesn't remain as 'sturdy' as other, thicker wipes. Once you put this brand of wipe in your hand and actually begin to USE it, it falls into itself, becoming like the size of a small cotton ball. (If you can imagine trying to wipe yourself, or a baby's bottom, with something the shape/size of a cotton ball, well you can see how that's going to be a bit of a challenge...a bit more 'messy'....)

That said, this brand is worth it in the end, as other wipes gave my tender bits some REALLY bad irritation that would often last for days in a row, even after I stopped using those other wipes...",4
"These wipes have truly been a life saver. These are the only wipes that haven't broken out my baby's bottom. I would have given them 5 stars, but I don't like how they can be difficult to get out of the package. Sometimes more than what's needed comes out of the package. That's just me being picky. Overall, the wipes have been great for my baby's skin!",4
"The packaging sucks but these wipes are the best for my baby. No more red skin on her bottom.",4
"When I first delivered my son the hospital supplied us with Huggies Little Snugglers diapers and Pampers Sensitive Wipes . When he was very little the diapers were perfectly fine even though I had my heart set on pampers and pre-bought a bunch of preemies, newborns and size 1's. Long story short - after a couple of weeks the Huggies started to leak and we we had to switch brands.I was super glad we had stocked up on Pampers diapers, which haven't failed us thus far.

HOWEVER, I do have to say that the Pampers wipes were not so great. The hospital gave us some wipes to take home with us and I bought about a million before little man was born.

After just a few days out of the hospital, we noticed that his little bum was a bit red and irritated and I assumed he was somehow getting a diaper rash - which was perplexing because my fiance and are I always on top of his hygiene. We took him to the pediatrician who told us NO to Pampers, even the sensitive kind, and that she has had babies come into her office with chemical burns from wipes such as Pampers and Huggies.

Her suggestion (or kind of demand) was that we buy giant cotton balls and use warm water. WELL, if you're a new parent or a parent in general and living in the real world - this is not as easy-peasy as it sounds. I was willing to do it because, well, doctors orders and I don't want my son to be harmed in any way. My fiance was less than convinced about this process but I was not about to let him use Pampers or Huggies or basically any other kind of chemical wipe. But I certainly I wasn't going to let him get out of diaper duty because it was too much of an inconvenience to use cotton balls and water.

I did some investigating and was a little unsettled about the hidden ingredients in most baby wipe brands.According to the Environmental Working Group's analysis of ingredients commonly found in products such as cosmetics and baby wipes - up to 95% of baby wipes, specifically, may be contaminated with impurities that are, mind-boggingly- not regulated by the government. While the ingredients in the wipes aren't necessary toxic in themselves - chemical carcinogens, namely nitrosamines, can potentially form during the manufacturing process, during interaction with what the item is packaged in and after the product has been opened and stored. Essentially, some of the ingredients in baby wipes become contaminated for the aforementioned reasons and thus become entirely different ingredients that technically are not required to be disclosed to customers.

I'm not a chemist and I know plenty of people who use and swear by Pampers and Huggie's wipes. Their babies and children are seemingly fine. It's doubtful every pack of baby wipes is going to cause cancer or contact dermatitis. And while not an alarmist - nonetheless, I was concerned about the information I came across. Also, I did not want to defy our son's doctor because she's totally awesome and an itty itty bit intimdiating. So that was it for me. I love you Pampers Swaddlers but your wipes gotta go and you can take most of your competitor brands with you.

Except WaterWipes. When I found out these wipes were made of mostly water with a hint of grapefruit extract - I felt like this could be an excellent compromise between warm water and cotton balls and easily disposable and safe wipes IF WaperWipes lived up to its claims. I read up on the Amazon reviews and the majority of the reviews were positive and encouraging; thus I decided it was definitely worth trying. I must say that WaterWipes has lived up to its promises.

Some of the reviewers claim these wipes are too dry. I kind of find this to be an issue with wipes in general. I've never used a brand of wipes that were super moist and stayed that way. It's just par for the course, IMO.

I love these wipes. They are gentle enough to use anywhere. I even sometimes use them to remove my makeup in a pinch, even scrub off mascara. At first I thought the tiny bit of grapefruit extract might burn my eyes, but it did not. Also, there is no heavy fragrance to WaterWipes, which I can't stand in most baby products. The wipes don't dry out while being stored. They don't turn yellow or start to look burnt in the wipe warmers like some of the other brands I've used or seen used.

I find it silly that some people complain about the price because it only has water and grapefruit extract. I'd rather pay more for simplicity that pay less for a bunch of chemicals that gave my baby red skin that was on the verge of becoming raw had our doctor not stopped us in time. I don't find the price to be outrageous - but even if it were - I'd probably still buy them for the sake of convenience. And, as I said, I like having them around for myself. I have a wipe warmer in every room and if I need to wash little man's face from spit up or his hands from drool or my hands from baby formula - no need to dash to the sink every time. I use these wipes instead, they are very multi-purposed.

The one little complaint I have is that they don't seem to come apart easily. I'm NEVER ever able to pull them out individually from the wipe warmers so we just lift the whole thing up and grab what we need. My fiance, my friend who is frequently here and mostly anyone else is able to take one wipe at a time this way. But I can't help but manage to grab AT LEAST four every time, but that problem seems to be on my end. Also, before we got the WaterWipes, we seemed to have a problem with ANY brand of wipes easily dispensing from the warmer or their packages. This annoys me about wipes in general but nothing is really perfect. These wipes, however, come pretty darn close.

I won't buy anything else and I won't recommend anything else.",5
"I've been using WaterWipes Plant-Based Original Baby Wipes for a few months now, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. These wipes are a game-changer for parents who want a natural and safe option for their little ones.

The fact that these wipes are 99.9% water-based is a huge relief. I feel confident knowing that I'm not exposing my baby to any unnecessary chemicals or harsh ingredients. They are unscented and hypoallergenic, which is perfect for my baby's sensitive skin.

Not only are these wipes gentle, but they are also incredibly effective. They do an excellent job of cleaning up messes without leaving any residue or causing irritation. I've used other brands in the past, and these are by far the best in terms of quality.

The packaging is also convenient. The resealable sticker keeps the wipes fresh and moist, so I don't have to worry about them drying out. It's also easy to grab just one wipe at a time, which is a lifesaver in those moments when you need a quick clean-up.

Overall, I highly recommend WaterWipes Plant-Based Original Baby Wipes to any parent looking for a safe, natural, and effective option for their baby's sensitive skin. These wipes have become a staple in our household, and I'll definitely be purchasing them again in the future!",5
"The simplicity of the ingredients, mostly water with a touch of fruit extract, aligns with my preference for minimalism and ensures a mild and hypoallergenic solution for sensitive skin. The softness of the wipes makes them ideal for my baby's delicate skin, and the fact that they are safe enough for my dog's paws and bottom after walks adds an extra layer of convenience.

Despite being a premium option, the effectiveness in both cleanliness and skin care justifies the investment. If you're seeking a wipe that's not only gentle on your baby's skin but versatile enough for your furry friend, WaterWipes is a thoughtful and reliable choice. 💧👶🐾✨",5
"We were using babyganics wipes on our newborn and they seemed to be tolerated reasonably well for her diaper area (some mild redness in the area) but, after a week and a half she showed the beginnings of a diaper rash and diaper creams really didn't help at all. The other wipes also irritated the skin on her face and triggered redness/inflammation of any milia she had. After reading how newborn skin is so sensitive and reactive to almost anything other than water I thought I would give the DermaH2O wipes a try. They have been splendid! The skin on her face and neck stays nice and unirritated when cleaned with these and the mild redness in her diaper area became fainter within a day or two of the switch.

I also started using a hair dryer set to low heat at around 6-8"" distance to completely dry her diaper area after every change before sealing up her new diaper and the results are perfect! The rash that was starting went away and the skin on her bottom now looks just like the rest of her skin - no redness or irritation at all.

DermaH2O wipes + warm hair dryer for super dry bum = perfect baby skin & a very comfy baby!
I won't buy any other wipe again.

Note that I do keep one finger near her bum while using the dryer so I can monitor how much heat she is being exposed to and adjust distance/time accordingly. She actually loves the hair dryer part of the change and gets very calm and looks rather ""blissed out"" when the warm air hits her (the sensitive parts are completely covered by the natural anatomy so its nothing erotic, just warm air on the exterior skin).

Update: After a year we are still sticking with these. We tried a couple other ""sensitive"" skin baby wipes such as the Lansinoh wipes when we ran low between orders and she had the beginnings of a diaper rash within a day. Back to the DermaH20 wipes and it was gone within another day or two.

Unlike some other reviewers, we have never had even a speck of mold on any of the wipes and I am very sensitive to the smell of mold so I would be quick to notice it even if it wasn't terribly visible. Not sure if we are doing something differently from those have had this issue; we keep some in a wipe warmer on the changing table and there is usually an opened, partially used pack of wipes in each of the two diaper bags we have. The opened packages in the diaper bags go unused for long stretches of time and I think it takes us a couple months to use up the wipes in these bags but still no signs of mold and they have surprisingly never dried out either and I didn't have them in any special container just the bag they came in. For us, they have continued to smell fresh and look clean even 2 months after the pack has been opened. The mold issue could possibly be regional. Perhaps we don't have the same strains of mold here in Southern California and what we do have is sufficiently inhibited by the amount of grapefruit extract that is in the wipes. I certainly have seen plenty of moldy fruits and leftovers around here but no problems with the wipes.

For any parents struggling with diaper rash I really recommend giving these a try and try a low heat hair dryer to get the skin completely dry before sealing up each new diaper (think ""as dry as the back of your arm"" as the goal). The main contributors to diaper rash are leaving urine residues on the skin (they react with components of the poop to produce ammonia right on the baby's skin) and leaving skin constantly moist (breaks down the hydrophobic barrier of the outside layer of skin). Everyone knows that leaving baby in soiled diapers too long causes rash but sealing diapers with skin still wet from wipes can do it too. Avoid wipes with any kind of emulsifier or typical lotions that are mostly water with emulsifiers and a little oil - both of these will trap water against the skin and degrade the hydrophobic barrier making rashes more likely. Adults don't have this problem with lotions (I slather myself with them regularly) because the outermost layer of skin gets much thicker after after early childhood. Before we left the hospital after she was born a nurse taught us that the only thing that really helps the diaper area is petroleum jelly because it can restore ""waterproofness"" to the skin until it heals. This advice turned out to be pretty much correct although I did have good results with pure organic olive oil (I preferred this to petroleum products) to help her recover from the rashes she did get when we tried other wipes.

Give these wipes a try and good luck with your little ones.",5
"I have used waterwipes for about a year now and I must say, they exceeded my expectations. The packaging is clean and efficient, the resealable tab is practical and ensures that the wipes stay moist and ready for use. The lack of any strong fragrance is a game-changer, providing a gentle and refreshing touch during diaper changes without overwhelming scents.

Moreover, these wipes exhibit impressive durability. They are thick enough to handle messes effectively, yet soft on delicate baby skin. The quality of the material gives me confidence that they won't tear or fall apart during use. Overall, these baby wipes offer a perfect combination of thoughtful packaging, subtle fragrance-free design, and reliable durability, making them an excellent choice for daily baby care needs.",5
"I've been using WaterWipes for my baby, and I couldn't be happier with the results. These wipes are truly a game-changer when it comes to gentle and effective cleaning for little ones.

First and foremost, the purity of WaterWipes is impressive. With just two ingredients—water and a drop of fruit extract—they're as close to pure as you can get. This makes them perfect for sensitive baby skin, preventing any irritation or allergies.

These wipes are incredibly moist, making diaper changes and cleanups a breeze. They glide smoothly, effectively removing messes without any excessive rubbing or tugging. I've noticed that my baby's skin feels clean and refreshed after each use.

One of the standout features is the convenience of the packaging. The resealable lid ensures that the wipes stay moist and ready for use, and it's also travel-friendly, which is a big plus for parents on the go.

Overall, WaterWipes have become a staple in my baby care routine. They offer the perfect blend of gentleness and effectiveness, and I trust them to keep my baby clean and comfortable. I highly recommend these wipes to all parents looking for a reliable and safe option for their little one's hygiene needs.",5
"I have used these as well as another brand's wipes on my little one. I like that this is not scented, very few ingredients, and cleans very well. I also like that it is not too thick so you can split it in half if you do not need to use a whole wipe in certain scenarios.

I do not think there is a negative I can think of for this product.

I have bought this package about 3 times already. I plan to only use these wipes.",5
"I have been using these wet wipes from the very beginning and have found them to be the best option on the market, yes, they are quite expensive and probably considered one of the most expensive wipes on the market, but they are very much worth it they clean and are very convenient The packaging holds up fairly well until the very last wipe and they do last quite a long time considering that you’ll likely use them more than a few times a day. I also even like the way that they smell. (it’s very slight, but there is still a clean sort of fragrance.)
I highly recommend these at least to try ones because they are very high-quality and the size and the texture and the packaging All seems to be very well thought out.",5
"Finding baby wipes that do not include a wide variety of unnecessary–and often harmful–ingredients was quite the challenge. While these wipes are not as tick or large as we'd like (especially considering the premium price), they are worth it considering that they only include one ingredient besides water. That said, we'd love to see a vendor offer premade baby wipes that do not include fruit extract.

For those of you who have babies with a reactive skin; we've used these wipes from day one with our little one who has a very sensitive skin and have had zero issues.",5
"I fell in love with waterwipes ever since we went to our first baby store for our first kid and they gave us a sample pack… I used it to clean the interior of my truck and after cleaning, it was still durable and wet. We had our girl and the wipes are the only wipes that didn’t bother her. They are soft and clean well. We’ve been using them now for four and a half years and I can still say, they are the best wipe on the market. Others are either dry, rough, or just plain fall apart, some have aweful scents but not waterwipes, it’s literally a great cloth soaked in water it a little soap, (not enough to see suds or anything). If on the fence, don’t be, these things are great!",5
